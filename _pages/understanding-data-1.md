# Overview

“Understanding data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students develop the critical, ethical, and rhetorical impulses needed to define data; understand its complicated relations to power, privilege, oppression, and liberation; and imagine ethical and responsible ways of working and advocating with data toward more just futures.

The resources offered under this literacy domain push students to ask critical questions about data such as:

- What is “data”?
- How and why does data ethically matter?
- What critical habits toward data are important to develop?
- What rhetorical dimensions of data need to be considered?
- What is data advocacy? And how can we think rhetorically about data advocacy and do data advocacy ethically and responsibly?
