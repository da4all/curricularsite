## Overview

Data Literacy, in the context of this project, is understood to be a nexus of mindsets, abilities, and practices that enable one to advocate with data in meaningful, ethical, and transformative ways. When it comes to data advocacy, we have identified three crucial literacy domains in which students need to gain experience in order to develop the critical-rhetorical capacities to ethically and effectively work with data to instigate social change. As evident in the chart below, we identify these three broad domains as Understanding Data, Processing Data, and Persuading with Data, and in each arena, we have identified four subdomains:

<img src="https://da4asandbox.github.io/curricularsite/assets/img/LiteracyDomainsFull.png" alt="The graphic is titled 'Literacy Domains of Data Advocacy.' Beneath that heading, there are three primary domains: (1) Understanding Data, (2) Processing Data, and (3) Persuading with Data. Under each domain are four subdomains. Under (1) Understanding Data, there are the following subdomains: (1a) Defining Data, (1b) Critiquing Data, (1c) Acting Ethically with Data, and (1d) Linking Data and Justice. Under (2) Processing Data, there are the following subdomains: (2a) Collecting Data, (2b) Organizing and Cleaning Data, (2c) Analyzing and Drawing Insights from Data, and (2d) Storing and Preserving Data. Under (3) Persuading with Data, there are the following subdomains: (3a) Appealing with Data, (3b) Visualizing Data, (3c) Mapping Data, and (3d) Telling Multi-Modal Stories with Data." width="100%" />

As so organized, these literacy domains are presented as distinct and linear. But we envision these domains as overlapping and reciprocal. For instance, it is important to think critically and ethically about data in all literacy domains. When we create maps with data, we are often telling stories. When we tell stories with data, we are often using persuasive devices. However, for the sake of organization, we have separated out these domains so that you, as teachers, can think about each of these domains more deeply and find relevant resources as needed.
 
Please click the Literacy Domains Tab to learn more about each domain and discover valuable resources to help hone studentsâ€™ abilities to work with data in their various subdomains.
