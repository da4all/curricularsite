Data Advocacy for All offers a collection of crowdsourced and adaptable resources to enhance student abilities to inquire with data, communicate with data, and deploy data for social advocacy.

Data Advocacy for All has been designed for teachers and students across the disciplines who have no prior data science or computing experience. Centered around three literacy domains and minimal computing practices, this digital repository offers open-access reading resources, ready-made data sets, tutorials, links to open-source tools, and flexible curricular resources such as activities, assignments, and modules.

Data Advocacy for All is a <a href="https://www.cu.edu/oaa/academic-innovation-programs/cu-next-award">CU Next Award Grant project</a> that has been realized by a team of digital rhetoric and digital humanities faculty at CU Boulder and Denver in concert with CU Boulder’s Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS).

# What is Data Advocacy?
<br>
## Definition
<br>
“Data advocacy is a deeply ethical and rhetorical practice of integrated analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change.” <small>(Laurie Gries, “A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Storytelling and Advocacy”)</small>
<br><br>

## Methodological Approach
<br>
Data Advocacy for All teaches data advocacy through two main approaches:<br>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Critical Data Studies
<p class="card-text">Best understood as a constellation of approaches, Critical Data Studies applies diverse critical lenses to examine various data issues in the context of existing power dynamics, emerging technologies, and socio-cultural practices. From data ethics to data feminism to black digital humanities, these approaches investigate how data functions as both an oppressive and liberatory force in order to help cultivate “more just, equitable, and livable futures” (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020, n.p.).</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Rhetorical Data Studies
<p class="card-text">As a critical and constructive framework, rhetorical data studies explores how data-driven stories, arguments, and visualizations communicate knowledge, garner public attention, and, among other actions, mediate socio-cultural change in order to help establish more ethically- minded and effective data-informed practices.</p>
