Data Advocacy for All has been designed for teachers who are interested in enhancing the literacies need to advocate with data for students across the disciplines with no prior data science or computing experience. This digital repository offers reading resources, pedagogical modules, ready-made data sets, tutorials, links to open-source tools, and flexible curricular resources such as activities and assignments.

# What is Data Advocacy?
<br>
## Definition
<br>
“Data advocacy is an integrative practice of analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change.” <small>(Laurie Gries, “A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Storytelling and Advocacy”)</small>
<br><br>
## Perspective
<br>
Data Advocacy for All teaches data advocacy through two main approaches:<br>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Data Feminism
<p class="card-text">Data feminism interrogates how data both propagates and resists sexism and other interlocking forces of oppression in order to create “more just, equitable, and livable futures” (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020, n.p.).</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Rhetorical Data Studies
<p class="card-text">hetorical data studies (Gries, forthcoming) investigates the links between data, communication, and power in order to better understand how data-driven stories and arguments generate knowledge, garner public attention, and, among other actions, mediate socio-cultural change.</p>
