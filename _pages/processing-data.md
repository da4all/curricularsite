## Overview

“Processing Data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students learn how to perform various operations on data so that they can extract valuable insights from data in critical and ethical ways.

Processing Data is often understood to be an iterative cycle involving several phrases. For the purposes of this project, we identify 4 key phases: collecting data; preparing data; analyzing data; and storing and preserving data.

The resources offered under this literacy domain push students to ask critical questions about data processing such as:

- What ethical issues do we need to consider when collecting data?
- What are useful strategies for preparing data?
- What are different ways we can analyze data to glean useful information?
- How can we store and preserve data to make it sustainable and accessible?
