## Overview

Data Literacy, in the context of this project, is understood to be a nexus of mindsets, abilities, and practices that enable one to advocate with data in meaningful, ethical, and transformative ways. When it comes to data advocacy, we have identified three crucial literacy domains in which students need to gain experience in order to develop the critical-rhetorical capacities to ethically and effectively work with data to instigate social change. As evident in the chart below, we identify these three broad domains as **[Understanding Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/understanding-data)**, **[Processing Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/processing-data)**, and **[Persuading with Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/persuading-with-data)**, and in each arena, we have identified four subdomains: 

<img src="../assets/img/LiteracyDomains.png" alt="The graphic is titled 'Literacy Domains of Data Advocacy.' Beneath that heading, there are three primary domains: (1) Understanding Data, (2) Processing Data, and (3) Persuading with Data. Under each domain are four subdomains. Under (1) Understanding Data, there are the following subdomains: (1a) Defining Data, (1b) Critiquing Data, (1c) Acting Ethically with Data, and (1d) Advocating with Data. Under (2) Processing Data, there are the following subdomains: (2a) Collecting Data, (2b) Preparing Data, (2c) Analyzing Data, and (2d) Storing and Preserving Data. Under (3) Persuading with Data, there are the following subdomains: (3a) Making Claims with Data, (3b) Visualizing Data, (3c) Mapping Data, and (3d) Telling Stories with Data." width="100%" style="border: #9AB1DA 1px outset">

As so organized, these literacy domains are presented as distinct and linear. But we envision these domains as overlapping and reciprocal. For instance, it is important to think critically and ethically about data in all literacy domains. When we create maps with data, we are often telling stories. When we tell stories with data, we are often using persuasive devices. However, for the sake of organization, we have separated out these domains so that you, as teachers, can think about each of these domains more deeply and find relevant resources as needed.

Please click on any of the literacy domains below or hover over the literacy domains tab in the navigation to learn more about each domain and discover valuable resources to help hone students’ abilities to work with data in their various subdomains:

    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">Understanding Data</h4>
      <p class="card-text">“Understanding data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students develop the critical, ethical, and rhetorical impulses needed to define data; understand its complicated relations to power, privilege, oppression, and liberation; and imagine ethical and responsible ways of working with data toward more just futures.</p>

  <div class="card hoverable">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/processing-data/">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">Processing Data</h4>
      <p class="card-text">“Processing data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students learn how to perform various operations on data so that they can extract valuable insights from data in critical and ethical ways. Processing Data is often understood to be an iterative cycle involving several phrases. For the purposes of this project, we identify 4 key phases: collecting data; preparing data; analyzing data; and storing and preserving data.</p>

  <div class="card hoverable">
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/persuading-with-data/">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h4 class="card-title">Persuading with Data</h4>
      <p class="card-text">“Persuading with Data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students learn how to generate persuasive data-driven content to assist advocacy aims for diverse contexts, purposes, and audiences. Persuading with Data is a multi-modal affair, meaning that when it comes to data advocacy, not only does data often come in various forms (numerical, imagistic, geolocational) but data is also commonly woven together with various resources for communication (words, sounds, images, etc.) to achieve various aims. To help students learn the various multi-modal ways one can persuade with data for advocacy purposes, we offer resources that specifically focus on: making claims with data; visualizing data; mapping data; and telling stories with data.</p>
