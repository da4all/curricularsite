title: "Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein, ‘Strangers in the Dataset’"

teaser: >
  This excerpt from chapter five of D’Ignazio and Klein’s _Data Feminism_, a section entitled “Strangers in the Dataset,” takes a critical look at the metaphor of “cleaning” data and assesses the implications of thinking about data in this way.  Questioning the validity of approaching data as dirty, and prepared data as somehow “clean,” D’Ignazio and Klein ask their readers to think more deeply about the assumptions that guide data the data gathering and preparation process.  The metaphors we use, they argue, embed deep assumptions that can impact how data is viewed, used, and potentially misused.  The reading provides an effective complement to the articles by Christine P. Chai and Alice Macfarlane, also included in the Data Advocacy Toolkit.
