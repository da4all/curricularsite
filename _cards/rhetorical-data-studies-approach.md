title: "A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Advocacy"

teaser: >
  In this whitepaper crafted for Data Advocacy for All, data advocacy is defined and explained as a deeply rhetorical and ethical action while rhetorical data studies is forwarded as a critical and constructive framework for helping students negotiate the rhetorical politics of accountability--the struggle over how to ethically collect, process, and deploy data, alongside narratives and other rhetorical strategies, to account for ongoing injustices in attempt to fight for social change.
