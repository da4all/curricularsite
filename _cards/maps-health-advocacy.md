teaser: >
  This paper provides a pedagogical primer on how to incorporate data and GIS-based advocacy into the classroom curriculum by offering a case study of LGBTQIA+ health challenges and barriers. In the paper’s Appendix, the paper’s author provides a sample lesson plan that invites students to critically evaluate maps and data visualizations that could be part of a data-based advocacy program, and develop strategies for how such maps might be used within a data-based advocacy campaign that seeks to advance the welfare of LGBTQIA+ communities.
