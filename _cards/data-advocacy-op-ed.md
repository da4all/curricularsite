teaser: >
  The primary assignment for this module asks you to imagine that you are working for a data advocacy organization and have been tasked to write a newspaper op-ed (600 - 750 words) that advances your organization's mission in the public sphere. You should choose an existing data advocacy organization and use the organization’s datasets, visualizations, or statistical reports as a primary source for their op-ed as well as deploy common rhetorical strategies and genre conventions of the op-ed to write a persuasive argument.

You will be evaluated on the basis of your op-ed’s capacity to: 
1. demonstrate command of genre conventions and rhetorical tactics common to newspaper op-eds;
2. incorporate your chosen organization’s data points as evidence in support of claims, appeals, and examples that are likely to resonate with general readers;
3. craft a clear, well-structured argument that reflects the mission and values of their chosen data advocacy organization.
