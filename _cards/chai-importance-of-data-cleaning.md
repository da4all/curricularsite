title: "Christine P. Chai, 'The Importance of Data Cleaning: Three Visualization Examples'"

teaser: >
  This article by Christine P. Chai, published in the online journal *CHANCE* by the American Statistical Association, establishes the importance of data preparation by providing examples of how inadequate data preparation can dramatically impact analysis.  Making sure your data is sound, representative, and in a format susceptible to analysis, is vital to both descriptive and inferential statistics.  The case studies Chai introduces demonstrate why data inspection and preparation is such an important part of the data science life cycle.
