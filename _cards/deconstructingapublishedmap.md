  This assignment will invite students to find a map that represents information about a social issue that they are interested in, deconstruct how that map “works” from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective, and explore how it might be used as part of a broader data-based advocacy campaign. The assignment will include a class presentation and short paper, and will prepare students to incorporate their own original maps into data-based advocacy campaigns they may organize in the future.

Students will be assigned into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Students are to find a published map that explores a social issue of interest (they may select a map from one of the websites in the assigned readings, but are not limited to these maps). In the final class, students will use their chosen maps as the basis for a class presentation that explores and analyzes this map from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective.

In the presentation, they should discuss:
- The map’s rhetorical situation (author, audience, exigence, and purpose)
- The underlying data used to make the map; for instance, the biography and thickness of the dataset
- The patterns the map is portraying
- The map’s design elements, and why they think these elements were chosen. They should also critique these elements, and suggest ways in which the map’s design might be improved.
- What narratives the map might support
- How the map could be used in a data-based advocacy campaign
- What questions emerge from the map that future research could help to clarify

They should also prepare some of their own discussion questions based on the map, and lead the class in a short discussion after their presentation. Presentations and discussions should last 15-20 minutes. 

Each group will also write a 4-5 page paper that analyzes the chosen map, and that addresses the questions listed above; if possible, they are encouraged to incorporate feedback received during the presentation and class discussion into the final papers. 

**Note:** Students are welcome to use a map that they already encountered from one of the sources discussed in class, but are by no means required to do so. If students are having trouble finding an appropriate map, they are encouraged to consult with the course instructor, or with a reference librarian. The instructor may also consider arranging a short learning session in which a librarian could provide general guidance on discovering a map appropriate for this assignment. For information on features of an effective oral presentation, students can be referred to the following resource: [https://www.gvsu.edu/ours/oral-presentation-tips-30.htm](https://www.gvsu.edu/ours/oral-presentation-tips-30.htm).
