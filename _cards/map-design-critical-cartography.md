title: "Map Design and Critical Cartography"

teaser: >
  This lesson introduces students to map design as an aspect of visual rhetoric, and will also explore critical approaches to cartography. It explores how map design choices can shape the meaning a viewer derives from a map, as well as a map’s persuasive power and visual appeal. It also introduces the idea of maps as social and political technologies that can be used as agents of control or domination, before exploring ways in which they might be reconfigured as tools of emancipation or social change.

# Agenda

## Video/reading discussion (35 minutes)

Begin class with a discussion of some of the issues raised in the videos that students watched in preparation for class. Some discussion questions might include the following: 

* How do maps distort reality?
* How are maps implicated in systems of power and authority?
* How do map design choices shape the narratives conveyed by maps?
* What does the Mercator map distort? Why is this relevant, from a political perspective? 
* What do we mean by map symbology? Why is it important? What criteria should we use in making choices about symbology?
* What accessibility principles should we keep in mind when making maps?
* What is the relationship between maps and marginalized populations? How can this state of affairs be changed?
* What do we mean by the “decolonization of mapping”? What are some strategies for pursuing this decolonization project?

## Critical Cartography (20 minutes)

Have students peruse this collection of historical maps from Stanford University: [https://www.davidrumsey.com/](https://www.davidrumsey.com) 

Have them select a map and answer the following questions (adapted from Erica Nelson’s lecture on critical cartography):

* What is the context of this map?
* Who made this map, and for what audience?
* What are they trying to portray? 
* What are their biases?
* What are the systems of power that the map reflects?

## Counter-cartographies (20 minutes)

Have students peruse this collection of “critical” maps (in small groups) that attempt to transform maps from tools of hegemony or control, to agents of emancipation or reform: [https://notanatlas.org/#atlas-maps](https://notanatlas.org/#atlas-maps)

Have them select a map, and answer the following questions:

* How would you summarize the map’s rhetorical situation? Consider author, audience, exigence, and purpose. 
* What is the map trying to convey or portray?
* What design choices do the map authors make that help them convey this message? Would you make different choices? Why or why not?
* What is your emotional response to the map?
* Does the map give voice to marginalized populations? If so, how?
* How could this map be used as part of a broader advocacy campaign?
