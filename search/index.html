Yet while more and more undergraduate students are being exposed to the technical aspects of data science, too few students are being taught the complex array of data skills, ethical mindsets, and communication practices needed to use data responsibly and effectively to advocate for social change. Data Advocacy for All aims to address this curricular gap by offering a toolkit of educational resources to help students think critically and ethically about data; learn valuable minimal computing and data processing skills; and practice generating data-driven stories and arguments in order to ethically translate data into effective real-world action.This educational project is grounded in critical data studies and rhetorical data studies and guided by the following data justice perspective:While coding and other technical skills are important for data literacy, students must also learn how to not only critically examine data issues in the context of existing power dynamics, emerging technologies, and social practices but also rhetorically use data to tell ethical, compelling data-driven stories and participate in ongoing conversations about pressing social matters.To help students develop such critical-rhetorical know-how, Data Advocacy for All offers a toolkit of diverse educational resources centered around three main data literacy domains: Understanding Data, Processing Data, and Persuading with Data. We welcome you to explore our toolkit to help students learn the critical, technical, and rhetorical skills needed to ethically negotiate the complex and reciprocal praxis of data advocacy in the 21st century. Learn More About the Literacy Domains of Data AdvocacyThe CU Next AwardThe CU Next Award is an academic innovation program that supports pedagogical development within the University of Colorado system. The CU Next Award requires faculty from a minimum of two University of Colorado campuses to collaborate on a pedagogical project that innovates with technology in order to help “increase the efficacy and efficiency of student learning in courses and degree programs” as well as “reduce technology-related and other barriers for individual and small groups of faculty.” To fulfill this requirement, faculty from the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Colorado Denver collaborated to design, implement, and assess the Data Advocacy for All modular curriculum over a three year span as well design this Open Access (OA) digital repository of curricular materials for instructors across the CU system and beyond.

Through defining data, this literacy argues that data literacy more broadly cannot be obtained without also learning how to define and interrogate data–to understand its complicated relations to power, privilege, oppression, and liberation.As such, this literacy introduces students to feminist, rhetorical, and equity data frameworks, all of which push students to ask critical questions about data such as: What is “data”? How and why does data ethically matter? What rhetorical dimensions of data need to be carefully considered? How can we enact equitable data practices?Such questions are especially important for doing data advocacy in ethical and just ways in our contemporary moment. This literacy thus specifically offers a theoretical understanding of data, an introduction to the data life cycle, and a brief dive into best practices of data advocacy in order to help students develop a strong rhetorical and ethical foundation from which to take up this important practice. Defining Data Toolkit  Readings    Glossary    Assignments    Activities    Tutorials    Teaching Modules    Datasets   </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">How to Navigate</h5> <p class="card-text">For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses.

When it comes to data advocacy, we have identified three crucial literacy domains in which students need to gain experience in order to develop the critical-rhetorical capacities to ethically and effectively work with data to instigate social change. As evident in the chart below, we identify these three broad domains as Understanding Data, Processing Data, and Persuading with Data, and in each arena, we have identified four subdomains:As so organized, these literacy domains are presented as distinct and linear. But we envision these domains as overlapping and reciprocal. For instance, it is important to think critically and ethically about data in all literacy domains. When we create maps with data, we are often telling stories. When we tell stories with data, we are often using persuasive devices. However, for the sake of organization, we have separated out these domains so that you, as teachers, can think about each of these domains more deeply and find relevant resources as needed.Please click the Literacy Domains Tab to learn more about each domain and discover valuable resources to help hone students’ abilities to work with data in their various subdomains.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">news</h5> <p class="card-text"> Oct 14, 2023 “Data Advocacy for All” presented by Nathan Pieplow at the Conference on Community Writing, Denver, CO, October 14, 2023.

To help students learn the various multi-modal ways one can persuade with data for advocacy purposes, we offer resources that specifically focus on: appealing with data; visualizing data; mapping data; and telling multi-modal stories with data.The resources offered under this literacy domain focus on these and other important questions: How can rhetoric—the art of persuasion—inform and enhance our data advocacy efforts? How can we use data to make emotional, ethical, and logical appeals to help achieve our advocacy aims? How can data visualizations and maps be responsibly used to assist our advocacy efforts? How can we tell ethical, effective, and affective data-driven stories to achieve our various rhetorical aims?Explore the Resources for “Persuading with Data” Subdomain: All Appealing with Data Visualizing Data Mapping Data Telling Multi-Modal Stories with Data Type of Resource: All The primary assignment for this module asks you to imagine that you are working for a data advocacy organization and have been tasked to write a newspaper op-ed (600 - 750 words) that advances your organization's mission in the public sphere. You should choose an existing data advocacy organization and use the organization’s datasets, visualizations, or statistical reports as a primary source for their op-ed as well as deploy common rhetorical strategies and genre conventions of the op-ed to write a persuasive argument.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource: This assignment will invite students to find a map that represents information about a social issue that they are interested in, deconstruct how that map “works” from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective, and explore how it might be used as part of a broader data-based advocacy campaign. The assignment will include a class presentation and short paper, and will prepare students to incorporate their own original maps into data-based advocacy campaigns they may organize in the future.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource:   Author: Lore Whittemore This "How to Spin Bisexual Yarn" PowerPoint discusses yarn as a form of data analysis.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource: Polish and revise a visualization you created previously.

For the purposes of this project, we identify 4 key phases: collecting data; organizing and cleaning data; analyzing and drawing insights from data; and storing and preserving data.The resources offered under this literacy domain push students to ask critical questions about data processing such as: What ethical issues do we need to consider when collecting data? What are useful strategies for organizing and cleaning data? What are different ways we can analyze data to glean useful information? How can we store and preserve data to make it sustainable and accessible?Explore the Resources for “Processing Data” Subdomain: All Collecting Data Organizing and Cleaning Data Analyzing and Drawing Insights from Data Storing and Preserving Data Type of Resource: All In this assignment, students apply the concept of a “data biography” to analyze the history behind a particular dataset: the who, what, when, how, and why of the dataset and its creation. In doing so, they learn about the different interpretative filters that shape the historical trajectory of a dataset, from its initial collection to its availability and usability today.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource: In this assignment you will draw inspiration from Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s project Dear Data. You will spend a period of five days and regularly collect some kind of information from your daily life. You will then illustrate the data you collected through a hand-drawn data visualization and submit the visualization along with a written reflection on the process and the big takeaways for data advocacy.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource: This assignment asks you to use the tools you’ve developed over the course of this module to begin understanding a dataset–a subset of the 2019 American Community Survey performed by the United States Census Bureau (The dataset with information about its source and the variables included is available at https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=county_2019. This assignment builds on lesson 2.3 (from the historicizing data module) and you should keep in mind how the project of counting the US population is inherently messy, and implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) caught up in questions of power. This is the case not only because census numbers are used by federal, state and local policy makers, but also because the methods and categories used to gather and organize data frequently make assumptions about what it means to be normal and about how people should be living their lives. At the same time, data can be a powerful tool for identifying patterns of injustice or systemic violence. As you work through this assignment, reflect both on how the ACS data embeds bias and on how the data might contribute to a responsible data advocacy project.   Subdomain:   Type of Resource:   Author: Friends Historical Library In 1847, Philadelphia Quakers conducted a census of the city’s African American population. Their intention was to document the existence of an “industrious and thriving” portion of that population, and also to discover what sectors of the community may have been in need of attention and assistance. Over 150 years later, the original data - held in manuscript at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College - proves a rich resource for studying African American history, genealogy, Philadelphia history, and more.

A. Einstein, B. Podolsky, and N. Rosen Phys. Rev., May 1935 Abs HTML PDF In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete. 1905 Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen A.

display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Toolkit</h5> <p class="card-text">## OverviewWith the Data Advocacy for All toolkit, you can either [explore by the resources organized by literacy domain](../literacydomains/)—or by the type of resource. ### Resource Types- **Terms:** Terms refer to concepts that are key to each subdomain along with brief definitions and identification of source. Most of the concepts are discussed in the subdomain’s open access readings.- **Readings:** Readings include open access sources that introduce students to important frameworks, concepts, practices, and strategies for doing data advocacy. A list of closed access content is also included on some occasions.- **Assignments:** Assignments include formal work that gives students opportunity to learn, practice, and reflect on their experiences with data advocacy. These assignments can also be used to assess student learning in relation to each data literacy domain and subdomain. - **Activities:** Activities include open-access lessons, varying in length and scope, that can be implemented in the classroom to help students hone their abilities to work with data in several literacy domains and subdomains.- **Tutorials:** Tutorials include step-by-step instructions for using various open-access digital tools to work with data. All tutorials rely on minimal computing, so no previous computer experience is required.- **Teaching Modules:** Teaching Modules include lesson plans that can be taught in sequence to help students gain experience with a particular literacy domain or subdomain. While all modules include readings, glossary, activities, and formal assignments, some modules also include tutorials.- **Datasets:** Datasets are freely accessible collections of information that can be used for inquiry, learning, and/or practice. Some datasets are referenced in activities, assignments, modules, and tutorials, while others are simply listed as potential resources and/or models for data advocacy. - **Examples of Data Advocacy:** Examples of Data Advocacy are a collection of projects and advocacy movements that utilize data advocacy to bring about social change. Like the datasets, some of these examples are referenced in activities, assignments, modules, and tutorials, while others are simply listed to further model for data advocacy.## Explore the Resources Type of Resource: All {% for resource in site.data.cards.resources %} {{ resource }} {% endfor %} Primary Domain: All {% for domain in site.data.cards.domains %} {{ domain }} {% endfor %} Subdomain: All {% for subdomain in site.data.cards.subdomains %} {{ subdomain }} {% endfor %} {% assign cards = site.cards | sort: "title" %} {% for card in cards %} {% if card.inline == false %}{% endif %} {{ card.title }} {% if card.profile.date %}  Date: {{ card.profile.date | replace: '', ', ' }}{% endif %} {% if card.profile.date and card.profile.author %}  //  {% endif %} {% if card.profile.author %}  Author: {{ card.profile.author | replace: '', ', ' }}{% endif %} {% if card.inline == false %}{% endif %} {{ card.teaser }} {% if card.profile.source or card.profile.license %} {% endif %} {% if card.profile.source %} Source: {{ card.profile.source | replace: '', ', ' }}{% endif %} {% if card.profile.source and card.profile.license %}{% endif %} {% if card.profile.license %}  License: {{ card.profile.license }}{% endif %}   Domain: {{ card.domain }}   //     Subdomain: {{ card.subdomain }}   //     Type of Resource: {{ card.resource }} {% endfor %}</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Understanding Data</h5> <p class="card-text">## Overview“Understanding data” is a crucial literacy domain for helping students develop the critical, ethical, and rhetorical impulses needed to define data; understand its complicated relations to power, privilege, oppression, and liberation; and imagine ethical and responsible ways of working with data toward more just futures.The resources offered under this literacy domain push students to ask critical questions about data such as:- What is “data”?- How and why does data ethically matter?- What critical habits toward data are important to develop?- What rhetorical dimensions of data need to be considered?- What is data advocacy? And how can we do data advocacy ethically and responsibly? Defining DataPlaceholder text defining the sub-domain.
