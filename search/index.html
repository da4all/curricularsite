Then we can access adn manipulate this metadata using Liquid, which allows for logic statements, loops, etc. I’ve outlined a couple of examples below.List of domains for this card:If a. particular card falls within multiple domains/sub-domains. This is listing out the domains based on the frontmatter:Checking consistency of metadataWe can also do a quality control check to make sure that the domain that someone writes in a specific card is spelled correctly and lines up with one of the site-wide domains we’ve defined separately in the _data folder:The tag 'Understanding Data' IS an allowed domain.Filter other cards based on domainsThis list is generated using Liquid to get a list of cards that have the same domain name as this card ( ie. Understanding Data ).

The goal of this exercise is to help think critically about how and why we describe, organize, and categorize information in certain ways.Imagine you have just moved into a new apartment. You go shopping and return with several bags filled with the following items: toothbrush cooking oil ice cream juice bread chicken baking soda soap apples beans detergent instant noodles coffee beans towels shampoo soy sauce rice bean curd trash bags peppers In small groups: Come up with a classification scheme for these items based on how you would store these items in your apartment Group individual items together under each category Explain your reasoning behind this classification scheme (ie. why did you choose these categories?)As a whole class: Elect one volunteer from each group to share your classification scheme for household items and your reasoning behind it. What differences do you notice between the different groups in how they organized and categorized these household items? What different strategies did they use? How would this exercise get applied to other kinds of data classification?Instructor Note: The general idea behind this exercise is to demonstrate to students how even something seemingly straightforward like household goods can be categorized and organized under quite different systems. Some groups might choose to organize in only general terms (what room in the apartment) whereas others will go into more detail - ex. kitchen items further differentiated by refrigerator vs. pantry. Some of these items are intentionally vague or could have multiple meanings and uses (ex. laundry detergent vs. dishwasher detergent, bell peppers vs. chili peppers, dish towels vs. bath towels). The big takeaway is that all classification involves decisions and interpretations - even seemingly simple ones.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Instructor’s Note Consider the following potential activities and discussion questions for this reading.Defining ConceptsIn small groups, try to come up with a working definition of the following concepts from in your own words: Counterdata “The Pitfalls of Proof” Data Ethics vs. Data JusticeAs a whole class, share each group’s working definition. The instructor should write these definitions on the board. Other groups should add to these definitions or ask for clarifications as needed.Applying Concepts Look around the classroom. Brainstorm as many ideas as you can for kinds of data you might try and collect about what you see. Ex. “We could count the number of people wearing glasses.” In small groups: choose one of your ideas and try to apply at least one of the three concepts (Counterdata, “The Perils of Proof,” and Data Ethics vs. Data Justice) you defined from “Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach” to that idea: Negative: How would you irresponsibly collect your chosen data? How might that data get misused? Positive: How would you collect this data in a way that follows one or more of the three concepts defined above? Additional Questions Do you think the distinction between “data ethics” vs. “data justice” is a useful one? Can you think of other examples of “counterdata” that weren’t mentioned in this chapter?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Collecting Thick Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">OverviewThis class introduces students to the concept of “thick data,” or using an ethnographic approach to collect detailed, small-scale information about people. Compared to “big data” that relies on aggregated information, “thick data” focuses on the practices, experiences, and interactions of individual people and groups along with the context and meanings behind them.Learning Goals Understand the concept of thick data Gain an introduction to ethnographic methods of data collectionBackground InformationReview the following concepts and background information with stduents.Big Data: Three V’s: Volume, Velocity, Variety Volume: massive quantity of data Velocity: accelerating speed of newly created data Variety: text, photo, video, etc., often “unstructured”“Big Data” Hype: Phrase grew in popularity in early 2010s Championed by Silicon Valley and technology companies Based on the assumption that the best way to generate insights or solve problems is to look at massive amounts of dataEthnography: The study of human cultures and communities Based on fieldwork, or immersion in a group or community you’re studying Observing and collecting qualitative data about that group or communityThick Description: Coined by Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (1973) Not just observing surface actions, expressions, or situations, but interpreting their larger cultural and social meaningsWhen is a wink a wink? 😉Compare these two stock photos: What is each person doing in these two photos? What is the meaning behind these expressions? How did you reach this conclusion?This is a canonical example from the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz illustrating the importance of studying not just surface-level actions but the meanings behind them. The picture on the left is someone who is involuntarily squinting one eye because it’s bright outside. The person on the right is winking. Unlike other kinds of closing one’s eye, the factors that distinguish a wink are: Intentional Aimed at a particular audience Trying to get across a message Part of an established social codeTakeaway points: “Thick Data” is a version of “thick description” Involves collecting information through direct observation Focuses on context and meaning behind what you observe and measureInstructions: Collecting Thick DataToday you will be working in small groups. Imagine that your group is a team of ethnographers studying the customs, culture, and social practices of the student body at your school. In this role, your group will: Choose one specific aspect of social/cultural life at your school (10 min.) Observe your chosen topic and write field notes documenting your observations (30 min.) Interpet a subset of your observations through an ethnographic lens of “thick description” and “thick data” (10 min.) Debrief with another group (10 min.) Instructor Note:This activity might be challenging to get through in 60 minutes. There are a few options to alter the schedule if you need more time for them to come up with a topic and collect information. You could have them each brainstorm one concrete idea and a plan for data collection as homework - then groups can choose a topic and dive more quickly into data collection. Or you could move the debrief/share section to either an asynchronous exchange of reports after class or have it be a warm-up activity at the beginning of the following class period.Step 1: Select your Topic Set a timer for 3 minutes and collectively brainstorm a list of ideas of customs or practices that you could observe about the student body at your school. Some examples: food, economics, sports, health, etc. Focus on nearby places you could actively observe in the next 30 minutes - ex. a coffee shop, bus stop, hallway, classroom, etc. You will be dividing your observations into two types: qualitative and quantitative. Half of your group will be making qualitative observations about what you observe, taking notes that describe what you are seeing, hearing, etc. Half of your group will be making quantitative observations - ie. counting or measuring the things you are seeing, hearing, etc. Choose ONE of your ideas to focus on that will allow you to make both qualitative and quantitative observations Make a plan for where and how you’re going to make your observations. Decide which members of the group are going to be recording qualitative observations and which members are going to be recording quantitative observations.Step 2: Field NotesObservations:Take “jottings” on what you observe. There is no single correct set of observations to make, but here are some questions to get you started: What is the setting/place you are observing? What noise do you hear? How loud/quiet is it? What smells are there? Who are the people you’re observing? From what you can gather, what kinds of people are they? What are they wearing? What objects or things are they using? Are they communicating with each other? What other interactions are they having with each other? What else are they doing? What emotions are they showing? What noise do you hear? How loud/quiet is it? What smells are there?In addition to these jottings,cChoose a few things you can count or measure at your chosen location. Some examples: How many X, Y, or Z do you see or hear? (ex. How many laptops do you see at the coffee shop? How many people are wearing hats, flip flops, or some other item of clothing?) How many times does X, Y, or Z interaction or action happen? (ex. How many people order coffee vs. another beverage? How many of these people say thank you when they place an order?) How long does it take for X, Y, or Z to take place? (ex. How long does it take each person to place an order?)Step 3: InterpretationAs a group, choose a subset of your observations and write a brief, 1-2 paragraph interpretation of your observations that includes both quantitative and qualitative observations. Don’t just focus on what you saw, heard, etc. but the why behind them - or the potential meanings of different actions and interactions. What beliefs, values, social structures, etc. are driving these behaviors or interactions?Step 4: DebriefEach group pair up with another groupEach group first share: What topic you chose ONE interesting quantitative observation ONE interesting qualitative observation Discuss what kind of contextual information did each of you need to have as an observer to understand the meaning behind certain behaviors or interactions? Taken together, do you think your two groups’ interpretations paint an accurate picture of the student body at your school? If you think of these ethnographic observations as “thick data,” how would you study the same topic using “big data”? What kinds of sources could you use? What would they tell you that “thick data” would not tell you - and vice versa?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">card testing</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Lesson 2.4 OverviewThis class uses the modern COVID-19 pandemic as an entry point into understanding how data is created and used within major historical events and processes and the role of historical archives in shaping data collection.Learning GoalsThrough this lesson plan, students will be able to: Study the role of data within the COVID-19 pandemic and the longer history of public health data Understand the concept of “data as archive,” or how data is collected and preserved within specific historical contexts Refine skills in working with spreadsheetsReadings Mars, Roman. Pandemic Tracking and the Future of Data. 489, https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pandemic-tracking-and-the-future-of-data/.(Transcript)Agenda Discussion: Public Health Data History (15 min) Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 Archive (20 min) Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 Archive (20 min.) Tutorial: Spreadsheet Practice (20 min)ActivitiesDiscussion: Public Health Data HistoryIn small groups: What lessons should be drawn from John Graunt’s study of the Bills of Mortality? Why was it a breakthrough and what were some of its limitations? What were some of the main challenges that the COVID Tracking Project ran up against? What solutions outlined in the second half of the podcast did you find most compelling? Which solutions seem hardest or easiest to implement? What are some of the issues around “aggregation” and “disaggregation” of data that are mentioned at the end of the podcast? Can you think of other examples in which these practices might impact data advocacy projects beyond race and public health?Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 ArchiveToday you will be examining A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19, a digital archive project that aims to “document, curate, and preserve experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the historical record.”Instructor Note: This activity centers on the COVID-19 digital archive. This participatory project invites users to submit their own content to the archive. The digital archive format will likely be frustrating and confusing to navigate and understand for some students. This is part of the rapid-response nature of the project and is a useful jumping off point for thinking about the information contained in archives, how that information is collected and made usable, and their silences and gaps.Explore the ArchiveIndividually:Take several minutes and start to explore the website. As you do so, take notes on the following: What seems to be in here? How is it organized? How easy is it to find something you’re looking for? How easy is it to stumble upon something that interests you? What challenges are you facing as a user? Go to the “Advanced Search” page for the archive. Search for a topic that interests you. Scroll through the first 5-10 collection items that appear and choose one of them. What kind of information is included in an “item”? How does it seem to be organized? What questions do you have about the archive based on this first exploration?Whole class: Which types (images, written reflections, audio files, etc.) of submissions are most useful in painting a picture of this COVID-19 year experience? Why? Which types of submissions resonated the least with you? Why? What was the user experience like in navigating the archive?Silences in the ArchiveWhen examining any archive or dataset, it’s important to always be on the lookout for its silences - ie. not just what information is in there, but also what is MISSING. One way to approach this is to study the geographical coverage of an archive or dataset. For the COVID-19 Archive, we’re going to use the Global Pandemic Map to examine where its items came from..ve-iframe https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/WorldMap width=80% height=800pxIndividually: Start with the most zoomed-out global scale and zoom into particular regions of the world: what countries are MOST represented and LEAST represented? Zoom down to your particular school. How well represented is YOUR surrounding geographical area in the COVID-19 Archive. Is your geographical area well-represented or poorly represented in this archive? Why do you think this is the case? Explore uploaded items that are closest to your institution. What seems to be in there? Whose experiences are reflected in these items? Whose experiences and voices seem to be missing? Brainstorm a list of 5 items you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area.Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 ArchiveThe COVID-19 Archive is a collection of individual items (news articles, photographs, written memories, oral history recordings, etc.) about the pandemic. But to make these items discoverable, the archive has to also collect information about them. This is called “metadata.” Watch this short video to gain a better understanding of this concept:.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE width=70% caption=”The Metadata Librarian Explains Metadata” (December 4, 2014)Working in pairs: Share your brainstormed list of 5 items you thought of that you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area. Choose one item from your combined list to contribute to the archive. Note: although you can make your own information as a contributor anonymous, the item you choose will be publicly available. Think about the issue of privacy when selecting your item. Go to this page and fill out the template to contribute your item: Work as a group and try to reach a consensus on what to include in the different metadata fields to describe the item. Note: it is recommended that you check the box to share this story anonymously, unless you want your personal information linked to the item. Whole class debrief: Based on the video about metadata and your own experience in adding metadata to an item, what is the purpose of metadata and why is it important? What challenges did you have in writing the metadata for your item? What was the hardest part? Was anything frustrating or confusing?Tutorial: Spreadsheet PracticeYou’re going to practice your spreadsheet skills using a subset of data that was collected through The COVID Tracking Project - the same initiative you learned about in the podcast episode you listened to for today. The following Google Sheet contains a subset of data from the project (note: in order to make it easier to work with it does not include ALL the data that was collected by the project):.ve-iframe https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing width=80%Instructions: Make a copy of the Google spreadsheet Create a new, empty sheet (instructions) and name it lesson-2.4 In the original Google Sheet of COVID data, use a filter to only look at data from a single state (you can choose your home state or that of your school) Copy and paste this single state’s data into your newly created lesson-2.4 sheet. The column positiveIncrease is a daily report of new COVID19 cases (suspected and confirmed) in that state reported for that day. Sort your data by the positiveIncrease column to find out: what was the largest number of positive cases reported in a single day in your state and what date did that occur? The column hospitalizedIncrease is a daily report of the number of people who were admitted to a hospital for COVID19 on that day in your state. Sort your data by this column to find out: what was the largest number of COVID19 hospitalizations reported in your state in a single day and what date did that occur? Add a new column named allCases: write a formula in the first cell that adds up (ie. sum()) the daily positive cases (positiveIncrease) and daily negative cases (negativeIncrease) for that day. Autofill that formula all the way down your rows. Add a new column named percentPositive: write a formula that calculates the daily positive cases as a percentage of ALL daily cases (positive + negative) - ie. what percentage of test results were positive? Add a new column named hospitalizedToPositive: write a formula that calculates a ratio of the number of hospitalizations for that day vs. the total new positive cases for a day - ie. what percentage of of people testing positive for COVID were hospitalized?Whole class debrief:Instructor Note: It is easy to forget when working with these nice whole numbers that there was a very messy process behind their creation. The last new column in particular stands on pretty shaky ground. The debrief below pushes students to wrestle with gaps and limitations of datasets and the tradeoffs of trying to use imperfect data. Did you find anything interesting in working with the spreadsheet? Did anything surprise you? What are some public advocacy projects you could imagine using this data for? Think back to the podcast episode and the challenges faced by the COVID Tracking Project. How confident are you in the “results” of your exploration of the spreadsheet? Do you trust the numbers? Given its limitations, do you think this data is worth using for a data advocacy project? Why or why not?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Critical Data Studies: An Introduction</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full open access "Critical Data Studies: An Introduction" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy Op-Ed</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">You will be evaluated on the basis of your op-ed’s capacity to: demonstrate command of genre conventions and rhetorical tactics common to newspaper op-eds; incorporate your chosen organization’s data points as evidence in support of claims, appeals, and examples that are likely to resonate with general readers; craft a clear, well-structured argument that reflects the mission and values of their chosen data advocacy organization.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Biography</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Part 1: BiographyYour assignment is to write a “data biography” about a historical dataset. This is the dataset you will be examining: Philadelphia African American Census 1847. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following: Introduce the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there? Where did it come from? Who collected, processed, and made it available? How was it collected, processed, and made available? Why was it collected, processed, and made available? How is it stored today? How did you access it? Potential problems with the data—are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So “Who collected it?” needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.Part 2: ReflectionBased on your data biography of the Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set, write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects. In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Data Feminism" book here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Justice</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Dear Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Assignment OverviewIn this assignment you will draw inspiration from Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s project Dear Data.

They should be: Regularly recurring in the course of a day Not too frequent (ie. not “how many breaths I take”) Not too infrequent (ie. “how many times do I take a road trip”) Something you have to actively collect instead of passively being recorded through a device (ie. no step counters/heart rate monitors) Think about the logistics of how you would collect information for each of your different ideas. Are you going to use a notepad? Will you carry this with you all the time? Your phone? Do you need to record just a checkmark for each observation or more data - ex. text, numbers, etc.? Will you need to measure anything? Based on feasibility and your own interest, choose what you are going to collectStep 2: Collect the Data Come up with a plan for how you’re going to record your data Note: It might help to set periodic reminders Keep a running journal that documents the process of data collection. What challenges did you run into? Are you noticing any patterns?Step 3: Visualize the Data You will create a hand-drawn visualization that illustrates the data you recorded. You have free reign to take this in any direction you want Note: you will not be graded on the aesthetics/design of the visualization, but on the effort you put into it. Here are some inspirations from Dear Data: Week 01: A week of clocks Week 07: A week of complaints Week 14: A week of productivity/schedules Week 46: A week of books we ownStep 4: Write a ReflectionIn your reflection you should include the following: The question you decided to answer Some of the ideas you came up with when brainstorming and why you chose your final visualization method Observations about the process itself - challenges, patterns, adjustments, etc. (draw on your process journal) What acts of interpretation did you find yourself needing to make during the process of data collection? In what ways was your data “cooked” rather than “raw”? How did you arrive at the data visualization itself? What choices did you make in representing the data? What challenges did you run into and how satisfied are you with the result? How did this small-scale process of personal data collection compare to the “big data” approaches used by private companies, schools, or government agencies? What are some of your big takeaways about data assembly and how might you apply these to data advocacy topics?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Deconstructing a Published Map</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Students will be assigned into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Students are to find a published map that explores a social issue of interest (they may select a map from one of the websites in the assigned readings, but are not limited to these maps). In the final class, students will use their chosen maps as the basis for a class presentation that explores and analyzes this map from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective.In the presentation, they should discuss: The map’s rhetorical situation (author, audience, exigence, and purpose) The underlying data used to make the map; for instance, the biography and thickness of the dataset The patterns the map is portraying The map’s design elements, and why they think these elements were chosen. They should also critique these elements, and suggest ways in which the map’s design might be improved. What narratives the map might support How the map could be used in a data-based advocacy campaign What questions emerge from the map that future research could help to clarifyThey should also prepare some of their own discussion questions based on the map, and lead the class in a short discussion after their presentation. Presentations and discussions should last 15-20 minutes.Each group will also write a 4-5 page paper that analyzes the chosen map, and that addresses the questions listed above; if possible, they are encouraged to incorporate feedback received during the presentation and class discussion into the final papers.Note: Students are welcome to use a map that they already encountered from one of the sources discussed in class, but are by no means required to do so. If students are having trouble finding an appropriate map, they are encouraged to consult with the course instructor, or with a reference librarian. The instructor may also consider arranging a short learning session in which a librarian could provide general guidance on discovering a map appropriate for this assignment. For information on features of an effective oral presentation, students can be referred to the following resource: https://www.gvsu.edu/ours/oral-presentation-tips-30.htm.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Exploring Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">PART I:Using a spreadsheet program or a software platform for statistical analysis (such as R), access the dataset and answer the following questions: How does the dataset represent the phenomena under scrutiny? What variables does it include? Which of the variables are categorical? Which are numerical? How do the variables selected for inclusion impact the kinds of inquiry you can perform with the data? What kinds of values are embedded in the way the dataset presents its information? Pick a numerical variable–for example, “population,” “age_over_18,” “hs_grad,” or any other numerical variable you wish to explore–and create a histogram of the data to visualize the data distribution. (Note: You can create a visualization for the entire United States–encompassing every county in the country–or you could filter first for a particular state.) How are the data distributed? Using the same variable, calculate the mean, median, and mode. Are these three measures of central tendency relatively close to each other? If so, what does their proximity suggest? If not, what does their relative difference tell you about the distribution of the observations that make up the dataset? Using the same variable, locate the maximum and minimum values. Calculate the interquartile range. Finally, calculate the standard deviation for your variable. Using the information about central tendency developed above, describe how your data are dispersed. Do the observations cluster around a central point? Are they relatively spread out? Choose another numerical variable and calculate the correlation between it and the initial variable you’ve studied. Interpret the r coefficient for these two variables. Does the r statistic indicate a strong or weak positive correlation, a strong or weak negative correlation, or no correlation? Why might this be? What might account for the relative correlation or non-correlation?PART II:Reviewing the calculations and reflections above, consider how these insights might inform a data advocacy project. For this part of the assignment, write a brief reflection focused on how your exploration of the ACS dataset might help support a data advocacy project. Your reflection should include two components: Brainstorm answers to the following questions, which build on your analysis from part one. What opportunities for further inquiry does your initial exploration help you identify? What kinds of power dynamics, structural inequities, or potential injustices might your analysis help identify? What kinds of information, including contextual and historical information, would be useful to help you answer these questions? Describe a data advocacy project that responsibly would build on the insights you’ve generated. What kinds of policy changes–including policies about data categories, data collection, and data use–might the insights you’ve generated help support? What kinds of challenges or injustices does your preliminary statistical analysis help identify? What kinds of help and input would you need to develop a data advocacy project?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Formal Critical Reflection: Defining Data and Doing Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Please write a 5-7 page formal reflection in which you a.) reflect back on your learning in this module and articulate what you have learned about data, the data life cycle, and best practices for doing data advocacy; and b.) apply this learning to analyze and comment on a contemporary enactment of data advocacy called Mapping Police Violence.This reflection has been divided into two parts. In writing your reflection, please make sure to attend to the questions posed below for each respective section. Note: Your tone may be casual in this reflection, but please write a substantive reflection that demonstrates deep understanding of the concepts, ideas, and frameworks covered in this module.Part 1:Revisit Journal Entry 1 and your prior conceptions about data. Reflect upon and write about where your thinking is now regarding what data is. What new or altered definition of data might you now offer? How has your perception of data changed? And why is this newer conception important to your understanding of doing data advocacy?Please also identify how you understand the data life cycle and its relevance to doing data advocacy. Along the way be sure to identify some of the best practices for doing data advocacy that you think are most important.Part 2:Please refamiliarize yourself with the three interconnected frameworks we covered during this module: data feminism, rhetorical data studies, a data equity framework. Drawing on concepts, ideas, lessons, and commitments gained from the readings about each of these frameworks, analyze and comment on We the Protestor’s Mapping Police Violence Project, which is part of their Campaign Zero Project.For your analysis, be sure to investigate We the Protestors and goals of the Campaign Zero project; read the description about the project (link at bottom of homepage) and consider the context in which this project was produced; learn about the research and resources, read about the methodology, and check out the data set (links at top of home page), and, of course, peruse the data visualizations (on the home page). As you study this project, put the three frameworks you learned about during this module to work to analyze the Mapping Police Violence Project. Pay close attention to: the designers’ exigence, audience, and purpose; what kinds of data were generated and how they were collected, analyzed, and presented; the multimodal choices and appeals made to produce the data advocacy website; what information was made salient and what information was excluded; whose voices and concerns were prioritized; how the designers negotiated the visual politics of accountability; how the designers attended to the data life cycle; and how the designers made (or did not make) ethical choices all along the way.Based on both your analysis and drawing on ideas, concepts, and lessons from the readings, how would you describe and evaluate the Mapping Police Violence project? Does this project enact best practices for doing data advocacy that you learned about during this module? How so or how not? Be specific! Also, what can be learned about doing data advocacy from this project that you might not have previously considered? Be specific!</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The History of Data-as-Rhetoric</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "The History of Data-as-Rhetoric" article here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Improve It and Prove It</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">First, write a paragraph that explains the rhetorical situation: How does your redesigned visualization address a data advocacy need (or exigence)? How does it relate to issues of power, ethics, or justice? Who are the intended audiences? (In other words, who needs to hear this story, and who is in a position to do something about it?) What effect do you want the redesigned visualization to have on those audiences?Then, write a point-by-point comparison of the two visualizations, explaining what each does well and poorly (and hopefully why yours outperforms the original). Write 3-4 sentences for each of the following aspects: the story in the data appropriateness of graphic elements decoration vs design appropriateness of comparisons use or misuse of common visual conventions appropriateness of frame of reference</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio: 'Data is Never a Raw, Truthful Input – and It is Never Neutral'</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Mapping Broadband Health in America</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Page content goes hereHeading 1Italics</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Mapping Police Violence</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Philadelphia African-American Census 1847</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Philadelphia African-American Consensus 1847" dataset here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Foundations of Data Equity" article here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">’Raw Data’ is an Oxymoron</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">The idea that ‘raw data’ is an oxymoron comes from scholars Geoffrey Bowker, Lisa Gitelman, and Virginia Jackson. It is predicated on the foundation that data never exists in a “raw,” unfiltered form and is never a neutral representation of reality. Every time data is created, it already is interpreted in some way - including through choices about what to collect, how to collect it, how to organize it, and how to store it. By the time data is being used for analysis, it has already been “cooked” in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Rhetorical Data Studies</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">[TITLE]</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> [BUTTON TEXT GOES HERE] iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The Point of Collection</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">What Gets Counted Counts</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">What is Data?
