The goal of this exercise is to help think critically about how and why we describe, organize, and categorize information in certain ways.Imagine you have just moved into a new apartment. You go shopping and return with several bags filled with the following items: toothbrush cooking oil ice cream juice bread chicken baking soda soap apples beans detergent instant noodles coffee beans towels shampoo soy sauce rice bean curd trash bags peppers In small groups: Come up with a classification scheme for these items based on how you would store these items in your apartment Group individual items together under each category Explain your reasoning behind this classification scheme (ie. why did you choose these categories?)As a whole class: Elect one volunteer from each group to share your classification scheme for household items and your reasoning behind it. What differences do you notice between the different groups in how they organized and categorized these household items? What different strategies did they use? How would this exercise get applied to other kinds of data classification?Instructor Note: The general idea behind this exercise is to demonstrate to students how even something seemingly straightforward like household goods can be categorized and organized under quite different systems. Some groups might choose to organize in only general terms (what room in the apartment) whereas others will go into more detail - ex. kitchen items further differentiated by refrigerator vs. pantry. Some of these items are intentionally vague or could have multiple meanings and uses (ex. laundry detergent vs. dishwasher detergent, bell peppers vs. chili peppers, dish towels vs. bath towels). The big takeaway is that all classification involves decisions and interpretations - even seemingly simple ones.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Instructor’s Note Consider the following potential activities and discussion questions for this reading.Defining ConceptsIn small groups, try to come up with a working definition of the following concepts from in your own words: Counterdata “The Pitfalls of Proof” Data Ethics vs. Data JusticeAs a whole class, share each group’s working definition. The instructor should write these definitions on the board. Other groups should add to these definitions or ask for clarifications as needed.Applying Concepts Look around the classroom. Brainstorm as many ideas as you can for kinds of data you might try and collect about what you see. Ex. “We could count the number of people wearing glasses.” In small groups: choose one of your ideas and try to apply at least one of the three concepts (Counterdata, “The Perils of Proof,” and Data Ethics vs. Data Justice) you defined from “Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach” to that idea: Negative: How would you irresponsibly collect your chosen data? How might that data get misused? Positive: How would you collect this data in a way that follows one or more of the three concepts defined above? Additional Questions Do you think the distinction between “data ethics” vs. “data justice” is a useful one? Can you think of other examples of “counterdata” that weren’t mentioned in this chapter?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Collecting Thick Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">OverviewThis class introduces students to the concept of “thick data,” or using an ethnographic approach to collect detailed, small-scale information about people. Compared to “big data” that relies on aggregated information, “thick data” focuses on the practices, experiences, and interactions of individual people and groups along with the context and meanings behind them.Learning Goals Understand the concept of thick data Gain an introduction to ethnographic methods of data collectionBackground InformationReview the following concepts and background information with stduents.Big Data: Three V’s: Volume, Velocity, Variety Volume: massive quantity of data Velocity: accelerating speed of newly created data Variety: text, photo, video, etc., often “unstructured”“Big Data” Hype: Phrase grew in popularity in early 2010s Championed by Silicon Valley and technology companies Based on the assumption that the best way to generate insights or solve problems is to look at massive amounts of dataEthnography: The study of human cultures and communities Based on fieldwork, or immersion in a group or community you’re studying Observing and collecting qualitative data about that group or communityThick Description: Coined by Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (1973) Not just observing surface actions, expressions, or situations, but interpreting their larger cultural and social meaningsWhen is a wink a wink? 😉Compare these two stock photos: What is each person doing in these two photos? What is the meaning behind these expressions? How did you reach this conclusion?This is a canonical example from the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz illustrating the importance of studying not just surface-level actions but the meanings behind them. The picture on the left is someone who is involuntarily squinting one eye because it’s bright outside. The person on the right is winking. Unlike other kinds of closing one’s eye, the factors that distinguish a wink are: Intentional Aimed at a particular audience Trying to get across a message Part of an established social codeTakeaway points: “Thick Data” is a version of “thick description” Involves collecting information through direct observation Focuses on context and meaning behind what you observe and measureInstructions: Collecting Thick DataToday you will be working in small groups. Imagine that your group is a team of ethnographers studying the customs, culture, and social practices of the student body at your school. In this role, your group will: Choose one specific aspect of social/cultural life at your school (10 min.) Observe your chosen topic and write field notes documenting your observations (30 min.) Interpet a subset of your observations through an ethnographic lens of “thick description” and “thick data” (10 min.) Debrief with another group (10 min.) Instructor Note:This activity might be challenging to get through in 60 minutes. There are a few options to alter the schedule if you need more time for them to come up with a topic and collect information. You could have them each brainstorm one concrete idea and a plan for data collection as homework - then groups can choose a topic and dive more quickly into data collection. Or you could move the debrief/share section to either an asynchronous exchange of reports after class or have it be a warm-up activity at the beginning of the following class period.Step 1: Select your Topic Set a timer for 3 minutes and collectively brainstorm a list of ideas of customs or practices that you could observe about the student body at your school. Some examples: food, economics, sports, health, etc. Focus on nearby places you could actively observe in the next 30 minutes - ex. a coffee shop, bus stop, hallway, classroom, etc. You will be dividing your observations into two types: qualitative and quantitative. Half of your group will be making qualitative observations about what you observe, taking notes that describe what you are seeing, hearing, etc. Half of your group will be making quantitative observations - ie. counting or measuring the things you are seeing, hearing, etc. Choose ONE of your ideas to focus on that will allow you to make both qualitative and quantitative observations Make a plan for where and how you’re going to make your observations. Decide which members of the group are going to be recording qualitative observations and which members are going to be recording quantitative observations.Step 2: Field NotesObservations:Take “jottings” on what you observe. There is no single correct set of observations to make, but here are some questions to get you started: What is the setting/place you are observing? What noise do you hear? How loud/quiet is it? What smells are there? Who are the people you’re observing? From what you can gather, what kinds of people are they? What are they wearing? What objects or things are they using? Are they communicating with each other? What other interactions are they having with each other? What else are they doing? What emotions are they showing? What noise do you hear? How loud/quiet is it? What smells are there?In addition to these jottings,cChoose a few things you can count or measure at your chosen location. Some examples: How many X, Y, or Z do you see or hear? (ex. How many laptops do you see at the coffee shop? How many people are wearing hats, flip flops, or some other item of clothing?) How many times does X, Y, or Z interaction or action happen? (ex. How many people order coffee vs. another beverage? How many of these people say thank you when they place an order?) How long does it take for X, Y, or Z to take place? (ex. How long does it take each person to place an order?)Step 3: InterpretationAs a group, choose a subset of your observations and write a brief, 1-2 paragraph interpretation of your observations that includes both quantitative and qualitative observations. Don’t just focus on what you saw, heard, etc. but the why behind them - or the potential meanings of different actions and interactions. What beliefs, values, social structures, etc. are driving these behaviors or interactions?Step 4: DebriefEach group pair up with another groupEach group first share: What topic you chose ONE interesting quantitative observation ONE interesting qualitative observation Discuss what kind of contextual information did each of you need to have as an observer to understand the meaning behind certain behaviors or interactions? Taken together, do you think your two groups’ interpretations paint an accurate picture of the student body at your school? If you think of these ethnographic observations as “thick data,” how would you study the same topic using “big data”? What kinds of sources could you use? What would they tell you that “thick data” would not tell you - and vice versa?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">card testing</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Lesson 2.4 OverviewThis class uses the modern COVID-19 pandemic as an entry point into understanding how data is created and used within major historical events and processes and the role of historical archives in shaping data collection.Learning GoalsThrough this lesson plan, students will be able to: Study the role of data within the COVID-19 pandemic and the longer history of public health data Understand the concept of “data as archive,” or how data is collected and preserved within specific historical contexts Refine skills in working with spreadsheetsReadings Mars, Roman. Pandemic Tracking and the Future of Data. 489, https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pandemic-tracking-and-the-future-of-data/.(Transcript)Agenda Discussion: Public Health Data History (15 min) Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 Archive (20 min) Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 Archive (20 min.) Tutorial: Spreadsheet Practice (20 min)ActivitiesDiscussion: Public Health Data HistoryIn small groups: What lessons should be drawn from John Graunt’s study of the Bills of Mortality? Why was it a breakthrough and what were some of its limitations? What were some of the main challenges that the COVID Tracking Project ran up against? What solutions outlined in the second half of the podcast did you find most compelling? Which solutions seem hardest or easiest to implement? What are some of the issues around “aggregation” and “disaggregation” of data that are mentioned at the end of the podcast? Can you think of other examples in which these practices might impact data advocacy projects beyond race and public health?Activity 1: Exploring the COVID-19 ArchiveToday you will be examining A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19, a digital archive project that aims to “document, curate, and preserve experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the historical record.”Instructor Note: This activity centers on the COVID-19 digital archive. This participatory project invites users to submit their own content to the archive. The digital archive format will likely be frustrating and confusing to navigate and understand for some students. This is part of the rapid-response nature of the project and is a useful jumping off point for thinking about the information contained in archives, how that information is collected and made usable, and their silences and gaps.Explore the ArchiveIndividually:Take several minutes and start to explore the website. As you do so, take notes on the following: What seems to be in here? How is it organized? How easy is it to find something you’re looking for? How easy is it to stumble upon something that interests you? What challenges are you facing as a user? Go to the “Advanced Search” page for the archive. Search for a topic that interests you. Scroll through the first 5-10 collection items that appear and choose one of them. What kind of information is included in an “item”? How does it seem to be organized? What questions do you have about the archive based on this first exploration?Whole class: Which types (images, written reflections, audio files, etc.) of submissions are most useful in painting a picture of this COVID-19 year experience? Why? Which types of submissions resonated the least with you? Why? What was the user experience like in navigating the archive?Silences in the ArchiveWhen examining any archive or dataset, it’s important to always be on the lookout for its silences - ie. not just what information is in there, but also what is MISSING. One way to approach this is to study the geographical coverage of an archive or dataset. For the COVID-19 Archive, we’re going to use the Global Pandemic Map to examine where its items came from..ve-iframe https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/WorldMap width=80% height=800pxIndividually: Start with the most zoomed-out global scale and zoom into particular regions of the world: what countries are MOST represented and LEAST represented? Zoom down to your particular school. How well represented is YOUR surrounding geographical area in the COVID-19 Archive. Is your geographical area well-represented or poorly represented in this archive? Why do you think this is the case? Explore uploaded items that are closest to your institution. What seems to be in there? Whose experiences are reflected in these items? Whose experiences and voices seem to be missing? Brainstorm a list of 5 items you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area.Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 ArchiveThe COVID-19 Archive is a collection of individual items (news articles, photographs, written memories, oral history recordings, etc.) about the pandemic. But to make these items discoverable, the archive has to also collect information about them. This is called “metadata.” Watch this short video to gain a better understanding of this concept:.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE width=70% caption=”The Metadata Librarian Explains Metadata” (December 4, 2014)Working in pairs: Share your brainstormed list of 5 items you thought of that you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area. Choose one item from your combined list to contribute to the archive. Note: although you can make your own information as a contributor anonymous, the item you choose will be publicly available. Think about the issue of privacy when selecting your item. Go to this page and fill out the template to contribute your item: Work as a group and try to reach a consensus on what to include in the different metadata fields to describe the item. Note: it is recommended that you check the box to share this story anonymously, unless you want your personal information linked to the item. Whole class debrief: Based on the video about metadata and your own experience in adding metadata to an item, what is the purpose of metadata and why is it important? What challenges did you have in writing the metadata for your item? What was the hardest part? Was anything frustrating or confusing?Tutorial: Spreadsheet PracticeYou’re going to practice your spreadsheet skills using a subset of data that was collected through The COVID Tracking Project - the same initiative you learned about in the podcast episode you listened to for today. The following Google Sheet contains a subset of data from the project (note: in order to make it easier to work with it does not include ALL the data that was collected by the project):.ve-iframe https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing width=80%Instructions: Make a copy of the Google spreadsheet Create a new, empty sheet (instructions) and name it lesson-2.4 In the original Google Sheet of COVID data, use a filter to only look at data from a single state (you can choose your home state or that of your school) Copy and paste this single state’s data into your newly created lesson-2.4 sheet. The column positiveIncrease is a daily report of new COVID19 cases (suspected and confirmed) in that state reported for that day. Sort your data by the positiveIncrease column to find out: what was the largest number of positive cases reported in a single day in your state and what date did that occur? The column hospitalizedIncrease is a daily report of the number of people who were admitted to a hospital for COVID19 on that day in your state. Sort your data by this column to find out: what was the largest number of COVID19 hospitalizations reported in your state in a single day and what date did that occur? Add a new column named allCases: write a formula in the first cell that adds up (ie. sum()) the daily positive cases (positiveIncrease) and daily negative cases (negativeIncrease) for that day. Autofill that formula all the way down your rows. Add a new column named percentPositive: write a formula that calculates the daily positive cases as a percentage of ALL daily cases (positive + negative) - ie. what percentage of test results were positive? Add a new column named hospitalizedToPositive: write a formula that calculates a ratio of the number of hospitalizations for that day vs. the total new positive cases for a day - ie. what percentage of of people testing positive for COVID were hospitalized?Whole class debrief:Instructor Note: It is easy to forget when working with these nice whole numbers that there was a very messy process behind their creation. The last new column in particular stands on pretty shaky ground. The debrief below pushes students to wrestle with gaps and limitations of datasets and the tradeoffs of trying to use imperfect data. Did you find anything interesting in working with the spreadsheet? Did anything surprise you? What are some public advocacy projects you could imagine using this data for? Think back to the podcast episode and the challenges faced by the COVID Tracking Project. How confident are you in the “results” of your exploration of the spreadsheet? Do you trust the numbers? Given its limitations, do you think this data is worth using for a data advocacy project? Why or why not?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Critical Data Studies: An Introduction</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full open access "Critical Data Studies: An Introduction" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy Op-Ed</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">You will be evaluated on the basis of your op-ed’s capacity to: demonstrate command of genre conventions and rhetorical tactics common to newspaper op-eds; incorporate your chosen organization’s data points as evidence in support of claims, appeals, and examples that are likely to resonate with general readers; craft a clear, well-structured argument that reflects the mission and values of their chosen data advocacy organization.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Biography</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Part 1: BiographyYour assignment is to write a “data biography” about a historical dataset. This is the dataset you will be examining: Philadelphia African American Census 1847. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following: Introduce the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there? Where did it come from? Who collected, processed, and made it available? How was it collected, processed, and made available? Why was it collected, processed, and made available? How is it stored today? How did you access it? Potential problems with the data—are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So “Who collected it?” needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.Part 2: ReflectionBased on your data biography of the Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set, write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects. In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Data Feminism" book here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Justice</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data Storytelling Presentation Assignment</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Assignment GuidelinesThis assignment prompts students to create a short presentation (5 to 10-minutes) in which they blend data points and vivid examples to tell a story about a statistical trend that sheds critical light on a social issue they care about. The presentation can be delivered in-class or in the form of a screen-share video using software such as Zoom. In the “Telling Stories with Data” section of our website’s toolkit, there are four curated examples of data storytelling videos that can each serve as effective models for this student assignment. In the spirit of these models, students presentations should craft a narrative out of three essential “building block” materials they’ll need to gather over the course of their research: Data: statistics, charts, graphs, or other forms of data visualization (students may find these through online research, they don’t have to create any data visualizations themselves) Examples: more specific “stories,” anecdotes, or case studies that let enable the audience grasp real-life situations that illustrate or embody the patterns from the student’s selected data Concepts: a big idea, theory, or finding that offers the audience a broad insight to better our understanding of the issue (i.e., helps us understand the problem better, or perhaps helps us recognize a solution more clearly) Selecting a TopicStudents may choose to research data about any social issue that interests them. It could be an issue or problem within a major political policy area (the economy, environment/climate, education, immigration, reproductive rights, crime, policing, healthcare, etc.). Alternatively, the topic could be something more local or “niche” that is quite specific to a student’s passion and has some importance within a particular community.Basic Learning Objectives to illustrate what the selected data means and why it matters through the use of examples involving real people to tap into relevant research on the topic and identify a concept that helps explain what we’re seeing in the data and the examples you’ve chosen (OR: to present a research-informed solution to the problem that the data and examples have established) Rubric:You may use the following rubric (or any variation of it) to assess student’s data storytelling presentations.[***Insert image of rubric here]</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Dear Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Assignment OverviewIn this assignment you will draw inspiration from Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s project Dear Data. You will spend a period of five days and regularly collect some kind of information from your daily life. You will then illustrate the data you collected through a hand-drawn data visualization and submit the visualization along with a written reflection on the process and the big takeaways for data advocacy.Step 1: Choose your Data Brainstorm a list of ideas for aspects of your daily life that you might record over five days. They should be: Regularly recurring in the course of a day Not too frequent (ie. not “how many breaths I take”) Not too infrequent (ie. “how many times do I take a road trip”) Something you have to actively collect instead of passively being recorded through a device (ie. no step counters/heart rate monitors) Think about the logistics of how you would collect information for each of your different ideas. Are you going to use a notepad? Will you carry this with you all the time? Your phone? Do you need to record just a checkmark for each observation or more data - ex. text, numbers, etc.? Will you need to measure anything? Based on feasibility and your own interest, choose what you are going to collectStep 2: Collect the Data Come up with a plan for how you’re going to record your data Note: It might help to set periodic reminders Keep a running journal that documents the process of data collection. What challenges did you run into? Are you noticing any patterns?Step 3: Visualize the Data You will create a hand-drawn visualization that illustrates the data you recorded. You have free reign to take this in any direction you want Note: you will not be graded on the aesthetics/design of the visualization, but on the effort you put into it. Here are some inspirations from Dear Data: Week 01: A week of clocks Week 07: A week of complaints Week 14: A week of productivity/schedules Week 46: A week of books we ownStep 4: Write a ReflectionIn your reflection you should include the following: The question you decided to answer Some of the ideas you came up with when brainstorming and why you chose your final visualization method Observations about the process itself - challenges, patterns, adjustments, etc. (draw on your process journal) What acts of interpretation did you find yourself needing to make during the process of data collection? In what ways was your data “cooked” rather than “raw”? How did you arrive at the data visualization itself? What choices did you make in representing the data? What challenges did you run into and how satisfied are you with the result? How did this small-scale process of personal data collection compare to the “big data” approaches used by private companies, schools, or government agencies? What are some of your big takeaways about data assembly and how might you apply these to data advocacy topics?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Deconstructing a Published Map</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Assignment DescriptionStudents will be assigned into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Students are to find a published map that explores a social issue of interest (they may select a map from one of the websites in the assigned readings, but are not limited to these maps). In the final class, students will use their chosen maps as the basis for a class presentation that explores and analyzes this map from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective.In the presentation, they should discuss: The map’s rhetorical situation (author, audience, exigence, and purpose) The underlying data used to make the map; for instance, the biography and thickness of the dataset The patterns the map is portraying The map’s design elements, and why they think these elements were chosen. They should also critique these elements, and suggest ways in which the map’s design might be improved. What narratives the map might support How the map could be used in a data-based advocacy campaign What questions emerge from the map that future research could help to clarifyThey should also prepare some of their own discussion questions based on the map, and lead the class in a short discussion after their presentation. Presentations and discussions should last 15-20 minutes.Each group will also write a 4-5 page paper that analyzes the chosen map, and that addresses the questions listed above; if possible, they are encouraged to incorporate feedback received during the presentation and class discussion into the final papers.Finding an Appropriate MapDiscovering an appropriate and interesting map to present is an important part of the assignment, which aims to give students experience in the process of discovering and evaluating secondary data sources and products. If students are having trouble finding an appropriate map, they are encouraged to consult with the course instructor, or with a reference or geospatial librarian. The instructor may also consider arranging a short learning session in which a librarian could provide general guidance on discovering a map appropriate for this assignment. Instructors may also wish to suggest some resources for students to explore, to get them started in the process of finding a map.

What variables does it include? Which of the variables are categorical? Which are numerical? How do the variables selected for inclusion impact the kinds of inquiry you can perform with the data? What kinds of values are embedded in the way the dataset presents its information? Pick a numerical variable–for example, “population,” “age_over_18,” “hs_grad,” or any other numerical variable you wish to explore–and create a histogram of the data to visualize the data distribution. (Note: You can create a visualization for the entire United States–encompassing every county in the country–or you could filter first for a particular state.) How are the data distributed? Using the same variable, calculate the mean, median, and mode. Are these three measures of central tendency relatively close to each other? If so, what does their proximity suggest? If not, what does their relative difference tell you about the distribution of the observations that make up the dataset? Using the same variable, locate the maximum and minimum values. Calculate the interquartile range. Finally, calculate the standard deviation for your variable. Using the information about central tendency developed above, describe how your data are dispersed. Do the observations cluster around a central point? Are they relatively spread out? Choose another numerical variable and calculate the correlation between it and the initial variable you’ve studied. Interpret the r coefficient for these two variables. Does the r statistic indicate a strong or weak positive correlation, a strong or weak negative correlation, or no correlation? Why might this be? What might account for the relative correlation or non-correlation?PART II:Reviewing the calculations and reflections above, consider how these insights might inform a data advocacy project. For this part of the assignment, write a brief reflection focused on how your exploration of the ACS dataset might help support a data advocacy project. Your reflection should include two components: Brainstorm answers to the following questions, which build on your analysis from part one. What opportunities for further inquiry does your initial exploration help you identify? What kinds of power dynamics, structural inequities, or potential injustices might your analysis help identify? What kinds of information, including contextual and historical information, would be useful to help you answer these questions? Describe a data advocacy project that responsibly would build on the insights you’ve generated. What kinds of policy changes–including policies about data categories, data collection, and data use–might the insights you’ve generated help support? What kinds of challenges or injustices does your preliminary statistical analysis help identify? What kinds of help and input would you need to develop a data advocacy project?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Formal Critical Reflection: Defining Data and Doing Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Please write a 5-7 page formal reflection in which you a.) reflect back on your learning in this module and articulate what you have learned about data, the data life cycle, and best practices for doing data advocacy; and b.) apply this learning to analyze and comment on a contemporary enactment of data advocacy called Mapping Police Violence.This reflection has been divided into two parts. In writing your reflection, please make sure to attend to the questions posed below for each respective section. Note: Your tone may be casual in this reflection, but please write a substantive reflection that demonstrates deep understanding of the concepts, ideas, and frameworks covered in this module.Part 1:Revisit Journal Entry 1 and your prior conceptions about data. Reflect upon and write about where your thinking is now regarding what data is. What new or altered definition of data might you now offer? How has your perception of data changed? And why is this newer conception important to your understanding of doing data advocacy?Please also identify how you understand the data life cycle and its relevance to doing data advocacy. Along the way be sure to identify some of the best practices for doing data advocacy that you think are most important.Part 2:Please refamiliarize yourself with the three interconnected frameworks we covered during this module: data feminism, rhetorical data studies, a data equity framework. Drawing on concepts, ideas, lessons, and commitments gained from the readings about each of these frameworks, analyze and comment on We the Protestor’s Mapping Police Violence Project, which is part of their Campaign Zero Project.For your analysis, be sure to investigate We the Protestors and goals of the Campaign Zero project; read the description about the project (link at bottom of homepage) and consider the context in which this project was produced; learn about the research and resources, read about the methodology, and check out the data set (links at top of home page), and, of course, peruse the data visualizations (on the home page). As you study this project, put the three frameworks you learned about during this module to work to analyze the Mapping Police Violence Project. Pay close attention to: the designers’ exigence, audience, and purpose; what kinds of data were generated and how they were collected, analyzed, and presented; the multimodal choices and appeals made to produce the data advocacy website; what information was made salient and what information was excluded; whose voices and concerns were prioritized; how the designers negotiated the visual politics of accountability; how the designers attended to the data life cycle; and how the designers made (or did not make) ethical choices all along the way.Based on both your analysis and drawing on ideas, concepts, and lessons from the readings, how would you describe and evaluate the Mapping Police Violence project? Does this project enact best practices for doing data advocacy that you learned about during this module? How so or how not? Be specific! Also, what can be learned about doing data advocacy from this project that you might not have previously considered? Be specific!</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">From Data Visualizations to Data Stories</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Activity OverviewIn this activity, students will experiment with tactics for assembling a variety of source material into a story outline. They will consider ways to strike a balance between data points and the lived experiences of individual stakeholders, and between local details and broader implications. The activity uses a recent article about the expansion of Amazon delivery hubs in residential areas as a case study and as a jumping off point to inspire students’ experimentation with data storytelling. The article appeared in 2022 in the Guardian, and it is titled “Are Amazon Delivery Hubs Making Neighborhoods Less Healthy and More Dangerous?” Plan to have students read it before the class day(s) in which you do this activity.Step 1: Discuss and ImagineBegin the discussion by reviewing for students the key points made in the article’s opening pages, which establish at the complexity and tension of the situation (i.e., Amazon’s expansion into Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood) Traditional warehouses vs. Amazon delivery hubs (operational differences) Difficult to quantify impacts on the Red Hook neighborhood (traditionally quiet, residential, but zoned to allow lots of warehouses) In response, and in order to make their case, the neighborhood group installed air quality monitors and traffic-counting sensors to quantify the impact of Amazon’s presenceNext, focus on the data visualization at the core of the article (which showcases the data gathered by the neighborhood group). After pausing to highlight some of the findings (e.g., 3,900 trucks passing through the streets on an average weekday), ask students to reflect on what it would be like live through these change, and to imagine how the introduction of a new Amazon delivery hub in their own neighborhood might alter their daily lives.Step 2: Possible Sources and Possible StoriesUsing the Guardian article as a jumping off point, ask students to consider how they might explore additional sources to tell an even more detailed story about Amazon’s presence in Red Hook. While the article does present a few anecdotes about how the delivery hub has affected local residents, it does not go into very much detail. Ask students to speculate about the kinds of research or reporting they might need to do in order to tell a more detailed version of this story.Next, supply the students with a list of the following hypothetical source material they might find were they to do some substantial research: National statistics tracking the increase in Amazon delivery hubs from 2018-2024 Interviews with local residents about how the Amazon hub has impacted their lives Instagram posts by outraged parents worried about their children’s health and safety Data visualizations showing the uptick in traffic and air pollution in Red Hook since Amazon’s arrival School newsletters announcing the change to a less convenient dropoff/pickup spot (in order to dodge the Amazon truck traffic on the road in front of the school) Government documents about the history of zoning policies in Red Hook Scholarly articles indicating the links between busy roads and childhood asthma Video footage showing Amazon-induced traffic jams around the neighborhoodThen, ask students to pair up and to outline a potential storyline that makes use of at least half of these sources. Urge them to think about which material might best hook readers who are unfamiliar with the situation. As they consider ways to connect the material into a narrative arc, tell them to try to strike a balance between data points and the lived experiences of individual stakeholders, and between local details and broader implications. Their goal should be to give readers a vivid sense of what it feels like “on the ground” in Red Hook, but to do so in a way that also stresses the general significance of this disconcerting trend (the reader’s neighborhood could be next).Lastly, invite students to share their specific moments from their outline and, as a class, reflect on the affordances and constraints that each of these narrative choices seem to entail. Give special attention to the different ways that students choose to mobilize data in the service of their storylines.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Gapminder World Health Chart Activity</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Instructor’s NoteFor this activity, have students visit the Gapminder World Health Chart website, and review the material presented on that page. The site presents an animated chart that depicts data about a nation’s life expectancy and income over time. Two accompanying videos provide interpretations of the data. Either before class or as part of the exercise, have students watch the animated chart and the YouTube video, “Hans Rosling’s 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes.” Divide students into small groups and have them consider the following questions, which can then be discussed by the class as a whole. How are income and life expectancy correlated? How does the correlation change over time? What other kinds of correlation does the chart suggest? (For instance, global regions and income and/or life expectancy?) Does the visualization suggest a correlation between population and income? Or life expectancy? Does the chart allow us to make any conclusions about what causes what? Can we assume that income impacts life expectancy? Or vice versa? What other factors excluded from the visualization might influence the correlation? What kinds of assumptions inform the presentation of data? How might forms of power or privilege play into these assumptions? Might there be other ways of measuring global health? Does the dataset presented say anything about quality of life? Focusing on per capita income (as Rosling notes in passing) doesn’t address distribution of income within a given country. Why would income distribution make a difference to quality of life or life expectancy?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The History of Data-as-Rhetoric</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "The History of Data-as-Rhetoric" article here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Improve It and Prove It</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">First, write a paragraph that explains the rhetorical situation: How does your redesigned visualization address a data advocacy need (or exigence)? How does it relate to issues of power, ethics, or justice? Who are the intended audiences? (In other words, who needs to hear this story, and who is in a position to do something about it?) What effect do you want the redesigned visualization to have on those audiences?Then, write a point-by-point comparison of the two visualizations, explaining what each does well and poorly (and hopefully why yours outperforms the original). Write 3-4 sentences for each of the following aspects: the story in the data appropriateness of graphic elements decoration vs design appropriateness of comparisons use or misuse of common visual conventions appropriateness of frame of reference</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio: 'Data is Never a Raw, Truthful Input – and It is Never Neutral'</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "Interview with Catherine D’Ignazio" article here </p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">An Introduction to Data Ethics</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The Limits of Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Page content goes here</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The Many Ways to Write a Statistic</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">IntroductionIn her article “Rhetorical Numbers: A Case for Quantitative Writing in the Composition Classroom”, scholar Joanna Wolfe tells an anecdote about meeting a pregnant friend for coffee. The friend had read an alarming statistic – that one in fifty pregnancies in women over 35 involved fetal abnormalities. But she felt reassured when her doctor told her there was a 97% chance that her fetus would have no problems. Joanna Wolfe pointed out to her friend that 97% is actually a worse statistic than one in fifty, which represents a 2% chance of a problem (a 98% chance that everything would be okay). However, as Wolfe points out, phrasing makes a huge difference in how statistics are interpreted: Why was one number alarming and another, slightly worse, number reassuring? As my friend said, when she read one in fifty, she thought, “I know fifty people.” It was easy to imagine one of these fifty experiencing a tragic event and to further imagine that this one unlucky person might be her. Thus, one in fifty is concrete, something one can visualize. One in fifty represents a number in the language of everyday lived experience. It makes the risk seem real, tangible. By contrast, 97 percent is reassuringly abstract and scientific sounding. It is also a number that years of school have conditioned us to equate with success: a grade of 97 percent is an occasion for self-congratulation, a reason to temporarily rest on our laurels. This example from medical statistics illustrates how numbers have pathos: the same number has a different emotional resonance with its audience depending on how it is presented. One rhetorical figure takes the concrete, fear-provoking structure of one in X will . . . while the other takes the more abstract, scientific-sounding structure of there is an X percent probability of absence. One alarms while the other reassures. Thus, the statement You have a one in twenty chance of winning excites us with its possibility, makes us grab for that raffle ticket, while the equivalent There is a 95 percent probability of losing suggests that playing is a fool’s errand, that to hand over money is to throw it against the law of scientific probabilities. In other words, translating a ratio to a percentage is not just a mathematical operation, but also a rhetorical practice in which artistic appeals are manipulated.Activity: Part 1Ask students to consider Wolfe’s reasoning. In small groups, have them apply it to this sample statistic: 68% of adults aged 65 years or older have gum disease (Eke et al. 2015.).Groups should brainstorm as many ways as possible to communicate that statistic in a sentence. One person from each group should write them all down. All sentences must be honest and accurate, but they do not have to be as precise as the original.Thus, for the purposes of this activity, it’s not okay to replace “47%” with “half,” because 47% is not 50%. However, replacing “47%” with “almost half” is fine, because the word “almost” indicates that the actual number is slightly less than 50%.Activity: Part 2Ask students to copy and paste their group’s list into a Google Doc or similar collaborative writing space.Once all the groups have uploaded their lists, ask students to delete exact duplicates, leaving only one copy (it doesn’t matter which). Only consider two sentences duplicates if the wording is exactly the same.Then, assign each group one of the following characteristics and have them read through all the lists to choose 1-2 sentences that best exemplify the characteristic.The group characteristics are: Most accurate phrasing (=most correct) Least accurate phrasing (=least correct) Most approachable phrasing (=easiest for non-experts to understand) Most professional phrasing (conveys the greatest scientific ethos) Best phrasing if you want to emphasize the problem Best phrasing if you want to minimize the problemActivity: DiscussionEach group should present their choice of sentence(s) to the class and explain the reasoning behind the choice. In the discussion, the entire class should seek to uncover underlying principles that govern the accuracy, the approachability, the emphasis, and the ethos of one’s choice of words.A key takeaway from this lesson is the idea that the wording of a statistic can have a huge impact on how audiences receive and perceive it.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Map Design and Critical Cartography</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Learning Goals Appreciate the ways in which maps might be used as tools of power and control Explore ways in which maps also have the potential to liberate and empower Understand cartographic design choices as tools of visual rhetoricReadingsNote: A “” next to a resource indicates that it is optional reading/viewing* “Critical Cartography: subjectivity, politics, and the power of spatial data.”YouTube, uploaded by HarvardHumanitarian, 5.

Some discussion questions might include the following: How do maps distort reality? How are maps implicated in systems of power and authority? How do map design choices shape the narratives conveyed by maps? What does the Mercator map distort? Why is this relevant, from a political perspective? What do we mean by map symbology? Why is it important? What criteria should we use in making choices about symbology? What accessibility principles should we keep in mind when making maps? What is the relationship between maps and marginalized populations? How can this state of affairs be changed? What do we mean by the “decolonization of mapping”? What are some strategies for pursuing this decolonization project?Critical Cartography (20 minutes)Have students peruse this collection of historical maps from Stanford University: https://www.davidrumsey.com/Have them select a map and answer the following questions (adapted from Erica Nelson’s lecture on critical cartography): What is the context of this map? Who made this map, and for what audience? What are they trying to portray? What are their biases? What are the systems of power that the map reflects?Counter-cartographies (20 minutes)Have students peruse this collection of “critical” maps (in small groups) that attempt to transform maps from tools of hegemony or control, to agents of emancipation or reform: https://notanatlas.org/#atlas-mapsHave them select a map, and answer the following questions: How would you summarize the map’s rhetorical situation? Consider author, audience, exigence, and purpose. What is the map trying to convey or portray? What design choices do the map authors make that help them convey this message? Would you make different choices? Why or why not? What is your emotional response to the map? Does the map give voice to marginalized populations? If so, how?

It is predicated on the foundation that data never exists in a “raw,” unfiltered form and is never a neutral representation of reality. Every time data is created, it already is interpreted in some way - including through choices about what to collect, how to collect it, how to organize it, and how to store it. By the time data is being used for analysis, it has already been “cooked” in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">A Rhetorical Data Studies Approach to Data Advocacy</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">NOTE This whitepaper is useful for the following purposes:• Introducing students to a rhetorical data studies approach to data advocacy• Defining Data and Data Advocacy from a rhetorical perspective• Deepening student understanding of Data Ethics from a rhetorical perspective• Introducing students to rhetoric and the art of rhetorical production</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Rhetorical Data Studies</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Mapping for Data Advocacy with QGIS</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Page content goes here</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Telling Counter-Stories with Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">OverviewThis activity prompts students to perform data-oriented research on STEM education in the US, and to develop their own claims about what might be causing the country’s ongoing deficit of STEM workers. Writer Malcolm Gladwell has argued that low success rates among would-be STEM should be understood as a psychological inevitable outcome rather than a failure on the part of STEM professors or their students.But there are other theories, based on other kinds of data, that put forth different explanations of this problem. This activity shares one such theory with students, and then asks them to further explore data on STEM education and employment trends in order to craft their own claim to explain the problem in ways that counter Gladwell’s perspective. (Prior to beginning this activity, it will be helpful to have students watch and discuss Malcom Gladwell’s presentation about STEM education, titled “Elite Institution Cognitive Disorder,” which is also included in the “Telling Stories with Data” section of our website.)Step 1: Read and DiscussIn small groups, ask students to read and discuss the brief reading “Five Questions with John D. Skrentny, author of “Wasted Education: How We Fail Our Graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.” After students have discussed the reading in groups, ask them to share the points they found most interesting, as well as how Skrentny’s assessment of STEM outcomes contrasts with Gladwell’s perspective. One key point of contrast to emphasize is Skrentny’s unique focus on STEM graduates once they enter the workforce. He notes that around seventy percent of them opt-out of STEM work at some point in their careers. Looking to such data on STEM employment trends, Skrentny argues that US doesn’t really suffer from a lack of STEM graduates; the bigger problem, in his view, concerns STEM employers and the inhospitable working environments created within STEM industries.Step 2: Research and SynthesizeIn the same small groups, ask students to browse the internet for additional data points relevant to Skrentny’s critical assessment of STEM workplaces. Students should aim to gather data that adds more specific evidence to Skrentny’s notion that STEM industry norms (such as a “churn and burn” culture, often accompanied by sexism and racism) are driving workers to leave STEM positions. Additionally, students should try to find recent, real-life examples of how these problematic STEM industry norms are showing up in specific workplaces today. Once students have gathered some relevant data and examples, ask them to share their findings and conclusions with the class.Step 3: ReflectAs a class, wrap up the activity by asking students to reflect on the two narratives, Gladwell’s about STEM education and Skrentny’s about STEM workplaces. Which arguments do they find more salient and why? How does each narrative help us to better understand the other narrative? How do both narratives, taken together, change the way you thought about STEM?</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The Point of Collection</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Three Creative Ways to Fix Fashion’s Waste Problem</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The Truth about Human Population Decline</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">What does Critical Data Studies look like and Why do we Care?</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">What Gets Counted Counts</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">What is Data?

Be prepared to share your three part response in class with instructor and peers.Part 1: Please describe your current understanding of and assumptions about data. Please also describe what educational opportunities, work experiences, and/or personal experiences with data have impacted such understandings and assumptions. Finally, if you had to, what is a one sentence definition of data that you can offer at this time. NOTE: Please do not look up any definitions of data to complete this portion of the freewrite. There are no right or wrong answers; I simply want to know how you define data at this point of time based on your prior knowledge and experiences. If you are unsure how to define data, it’s okay. Write about why you are uncertain and what you think it is.Part 2: View the Slideshow titled “What is Data?” [Insert What is Data Slideshow? Here]Which of the quote(s) about data most resonates with you and why? In answering this question, please be sure to a.) unpack the quote, meaning explain what you understand it to be saying; and b.) explain why you find it compelling, true, and/or significant. NOTE: You can choose to focus on more than one quote.Part 3: Go back to your original thoughts and definitions of data in the first part of this freewrite. Now, considering what you wrote about quotes and data in part 2 of this prompt, how has your conception of data changed, expanded, shifted? How might you define data now?Folow Up Discussion: What is Data?Begin this discussion with an explanation as to why it is important to develop a deep theoretical understanding of data in order to do data advocacy, emphasizing how data is often defined differently and thus not a simple concept. Also, be sure to identify how data is discussed in a singular vs. plural sense. Then, as a whole class, share and discuss student responses to all three entries for the critical reflection prompt above. Be sure to unpack the quotes from the slideshow “What is Data?” together as well as discuss where student perspectives of data started out and where they are now. Emphasize that their current conceptions are not cemented, as they will likely shift as they work in different contexts and for various purposes.</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">The What, Where and How of Data for Data Science</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"> Access the full "The What, Where and How of Data for Data Science" article here iFrame HERE</p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">Why Big Data Needs Thick Data</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;"></p> </div> <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 20px; display: none;"> <h5 class="card-title">World Happiness Report (2023)</h5> <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 10px;">Instructor Information:The World Happiness Report ranks nations based on their citizens’ evaluations of their overall wellbeing. The public data (gathered by the Gallup World Poll) is available on this website (under the heading “Data for Table 2.1”); a description of the variables is available in this appendix. Once students have access to the data on a software platform of your choice, organize them in small groups and have each group work through the following questions. Encourage students to help each other with coding or making the specified calculations on a spreadsheet. Spend some time reviewing the variables as described in the appendix. Ask students to consider the following questions: What kind of variables are included? What is the significance of gauging national wellbeing through primarily subjective measures? How are the various measures defined? Can you think of other possible measures of subjective wellbeing? What is the effect of using the selected variables and not others? Whose perspectives are being privileged by choosing these variables and excluding others? Ask students to measure the correlation between the observations in the “Life Ladder” column–which is the numerical measure of subjective happiness–and each of the additional variables. Which variables are most correlated to the life ladder variable? Which are less strongly correlated? What advantages might there be to focusing on subjective measures of happiness to understanding and attempting to impact development? What might be the advantages to surveys of citizens as opposed to exclusively objective economic measures of national prosperity? What benefits might there be for policy makers using this data, again, instead of relying solely on measures of poverty or economic activity to gauge relative development? What might be some limits of the World Happiness Report’s approach to understanding development? Does it make a difference to understanding the validity of this report that not all cultures or religious traditions value happiness as a subjective state? Is happiness a universally agreed upon state? What potential harms might follow from using this data for policy making?</p> </div> </div> <script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){o.forEach(t=>{const n=t.textContent.toLowerCase(),c=n.replace(new RegExp(e,"gi"),e=>`<span style="background-color: yellow;">${e}</span>`);n.includes(e)?(t.style.display="block",t.innerHTML=c):t.style.display="none"})}const t=document.getElementById("search-input"),n=document.getElementById("search-button"),c=document.getElementById("clear-search"),o=(document.getElementById("card-list"),[...document.querySelectorAll(".card")]);n.addEventListener("click",function(){e(t.value.trim().toLowerCase())}),c.addEventListener("click",function(){t.value="",e("")})});</script> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Data Advocacy for All .
