Rather than treat Big Data as only scientifically empirical and therefore largely neutral phenomena, CDS advocates the view that Big Data should be seen as always-already constituted within wider data assemblages. Assemblages is a concept that helps capture the multitude of ways that already-composed data structures inflect and interact with society, its organization and functioning, and the resulting impact on individuals’ daily lives. CDS questions the many assumptions about Big Data that permeate contemporary literature on information and society by locating instances where Big Data may be naively taken to denote objective and transparent informational entities. In this introduction to the Big Data &amp; Society CDS special theme, we briefly describe CDS work, its orientations, and principles. </p> <small class="test-muted"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Source: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951716674238" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951716674238</a></small> <div class="expanded-content"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.5.2/cdn/themes/light.css"> <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.5.2/cdn/shoelace.js"></script> <div> <center> <sl-button-group label="Alignment"> <sl-button href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951716674238">Access the full open access "Critical Data Studies: An Introduction" article here</sl-button> </sl-button-group> </center> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Data Feminism</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>Data feminism can be understood as a framework for thinking about data and its relation to power through the lens of intersectional feminism as well as working toward just data practices. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Data</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>Rather than impose a singular definition of data upon students, data in this toolkit is presented from a variety of perspectives to highlight its relations to bodies, ethics, rhetoric, and power. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Data Advocacy</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>Data advocacy is a deeply ethical and rhetorical practice of integrated analysis, design, and communication in which insights from a dataset are effectively conveyed to raise public awareness and drive social change.

Klein</small><br> </p> <p>A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed. </p> <small class="test-muted"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Source: <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/</a></small> <div class="expanded-content"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.5.2/cdn/themes/light.css"> <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.5.2/cdn/shoelace.js"></script> <div> <center> <sl-button-group label="Alignment"> <sl-button href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/">Access the full "Data Feminism" book here</sl-button> </sl-button-group> </center> </div> <p><br></p> <iframe width="100%" height="1000" src="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/" allowfullscreen="">iFrame HERE</iframe> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Data Justice</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>Data Justice refers to equity and fairness in the way people and pressing social issues are disclosed, represented, and treated as a result of the collection, analysis, production, and presentation of data. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Formal Critical Reflection: Defining Data and Doing Data Advocacy</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>This two-part formal critical reflection asks students to write a 5-7 page essay in which they a.) reflect back on their learning about data feminism, rhetorical data studies, and an equity framework and forward their own understandings of data, the data life cycle, and best practices for doing data advocacy; b.) apply learning to describe and analyze a data advocacy website; and c.) reflect on how this learning prepares them to do data advocacy. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> <p>Please write a 5-7 page formal reflection in which you a.) reflect back on your learning in this module and articulate what you have learned about data, the data life cycle, and best practices for doing data advocacy; and b.) apply this learning to analyze and comment on a contemporary enactment of data advocacy called <em>Mapping Police Violence.</em></p> <p>This reflection has been divided into two parts. In writing your reflection, please make sure to attend to the questions posed below for each respective section. Note: Your tone may be casual in this reflection, but please write a substantive reflection that demonstrates deep understanding of the concepts, ideas, and frameworks covered in this module.</p> <h2 id="part-1">Part 1:</h2> <p>Revisit Journal Entry 1 and your prior conceptions about data. Reflect upon and write about where your thinking is now regarding what data is. What new or altered definition of data might you now offer? How has your perception of data changed? And why is this newer conception important to your understanding of doing data advocacy?</p> <p>Please also identify how you understand the data life cycle and its relevance to doing data advocacy. Along the way be sure to identify some of the best practices for doing data advocacy that you think are most important.</p> <h2 id="part-2">Part 2:</h2> <p>Please refamiliarize yourself with the three interconnected frameworks we covered during this module: data feminism, rhetorical data studies, a data equity framework. Drawing on concepts, ideas, lessons, and commitments gained from the readings about each of these frameworks, analyze and comment on We the Protestor’s <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mapping Police Violence Project,</em></a> which is part of their Campaign Zero Project.</p> <p>For your analysis, be sure to investigate <a href="https://campaignzero.org/about/what-we-do/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">We the Protestors and goals of the Campaign Zero project;</a> read the description about the project (link at bottom of homepage) and consider the context in which this project was produced; learn about the research and resources, read about the methodology, and check out the data set (links at top of home page), and, of course, peruse the data visualizations (on the home page). As you study this project, put the three frameworks you learned about during this module to work to analyze the Mapping Police Violence Project. Pay close attention to:</p> <ul> <li>the designers’ exigence, audience, and purpose;</li> <li>what kinds of data were generated and how they were collected, analyzed, and presented;</li> <li>the multimodal choices and appeals made to produce the data advocacy website;</li> <li>what information was made salient and what information was excluded;</li> <li>whose voices and concerns were prioritized;</li> <li>how the designers negotiated the visual politics of accountability;</li> <li>how the designers attended to the data life cycle;</li> <li>and how the designers made (or did not make) ethical choices all along the way.</li> </ul> <p>Based on both your analysis and drawing on ideas, concepts, and lessons from the readings, how would you describe and evaluate the Mapping Police Violence project? Does this project enact best practices for doing data advocacy that you learned about during this module? How so or how not? Be specific! Also, what can be learned about doing data advocacy from this project that you might not have previously considered?

In doing so, they learn about the different interpretative filters that shape the historical trajectory of a dataset, from its initial collection to its availability and usability today. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> <h2 id="part-1-biography">Part 1: Biography</h2> <p>Your assignment is to write a “data biography” about a historical dataset. This is the dataset you will be examining: <a href="https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Philadelphia African American Census 1847</a>. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Introduce</strong> the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there?</li> <li> <strong>Where</strong> did it come from?</li> <li> <strong>Who</strong> collected, processed, and made it available?</li> <li> <strong>How</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li> <li> <strong>Why</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li> <li> <strong>How</strong> is it stored today? How did you access it?</li> <li> <strong>Potential problems</strong> with the data—are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?</li> </ul> <p>Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So “Who collected it?” needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.</p> <h2 id="part-2-reflection">Part 2: Reflection</h2> <p>Based on your data biography of the <a href="https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set</a>, write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order <strong>to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects.</strong> In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Dear Data</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> </p> <p>In this assignment you will draw inspiration from Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s project <i>Dear Data.</i> You will spend a period of five days and regularly collect some kind of information from your daily life.

Are you going to use a notepad? Will you carry this with you all the time? Your phone? Do you need to record just a checkmark for each observation or more data - ex. text, numbers, etc.?

This assignment builds on lesson 2.3 (from the historicizing data module) and you should keep in mind how the project of counting the US population is inherently messy, and implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) caught up in questions of power. This is the case not only because census numbers are used by federal, state and local policy makers, but also because the methods and categories used to gather and organize data frequently make assumptions about what it means to be normal and about how people should be living their lives. At the same time, data can be a powerful tool for identifying patterns of injustice or systemic violence. As you work through this assignment, reflect both on how the ACS data embeds bias and on how the data might contribute to a responsible data advocacy project. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> <h2 id="part-i">PART I:</h2> <p>Using a spreadsheet program or a software platform for statistical analysis (such as R), access the dataset and answer the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>How does the dataset represent the phenomena under scrutiny? What variables does it include? Which of the variables are categorical? Which are numerical? How do the variables selected for inclusion impact the kinds of inquiry you can perform with the data? What kinds of values are embedded in the way the dataset presents its information?</li> <li>Pick a numerical variable–for example, “population,” “age_over_18,” “hs_grad,” or any other numerical variable you wish to explore–and create a histogram of the data to visualize the data distribution. (Note: You can create a visualization for the entire United States–encompassing every county in the country–or you could filter first for a particular state.) How are the data distributed?</li> <li>Using the same variable, calculate the mean, median, and mode. Are these three measures of central tendency relatively close to each other? If so, what does their proximity suggest? If not, what does their relative difference tell you about the distribution of the observations that make up the dataset?</li> <li>Using the same variable, locate the maximum and minimum values. Calculate the interquartile range. Finally, calculate the standard deviation for your variable. Using the information about central tendency developed above, describe how your data are dispersed. Do the observations cluster around a central point? Are they relatively spread out?</li> <li>Choose another numerical variable and calculate the correlation between it and the initial variable you’ve studied. Interpret the r coefficient for these two variables. Does the r statistic indicate a strong or weak positive correlation, a strong or weak negative correlation, or no correlation? Why might this be? What might account for the relative correlation or non-correlation?</li> </ul> <h2 id="part-ii">PART II:</h2> <p>Reviewing the calculations and reflections above, consider how these insights might inform a data advocacy project. For this part of the assignment, write a brief reflection focused on how your exploration of the ACS dataset might help support a data advocacy project. Your reflection should include two components:</p> <ol> <li>Brainstorm answers to the following questions, which build on your analysis from part one. What opportunities for further inquiry does your initial exploration help you identify? What kinds of power dynamics, structural inequities, or potential injustices might your analysis help identify? What kinds of information, including contextual and historical information, would be useful to help you answer these questions?</li> <li>Describe a data advocacy project that responsibly would build on the insights you’ve generated. What kinds of policy changes–including policies about data categories, data collection, and data use–might the insights you’ve generated help support? What kinds of challenges or injustices does your preliminary statistical analysis help identify? What kinds of help and input would you need to develop a data advocacy project?</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="card-header"> <h3 class="card-title">Philadelphia African-American Census 1847</h3> <button class="toggle-button">Expand</button> </div> <div class="card-content" style="display: none;"> <p> <small class="test-muted">Author: Friends Historical Library</small><br> </p> <p>In 1847, Philadelphia Quakers conducted a census of the city’s African American population.

The assignment will include a class presentation and short paper, and will prepare students to incorporate their own original maps into data-based advocacy campaigns they may organize in the future. </p> <div class="expanded-content"> <p>Students will be assigned into groups of 2-4 (depending on class size). Students are to find a published map that explores a social issue of interest (they may select a map from one of the websites in the assigned readings, but are not limited to these maps). In the final class, students will use their chosen maps as the basis for a class presentation that explores and analyzes this map from a rhetorical and data-advocacy perspective.</p> <p>In the presentation, they should discuss:</p> <ul> <li>The map’s rhetorical situation (author, audience, exigence, and purpose)</li> <li>The underlying data used to make the map; for instance, the biography and thickness of the dataset</li> <li>The patterns the map is portraying</li> <li>The map’s design elements, and why they think these elements were chosen. They should also critique these elements, and suggest ways in which the map’s design might be improved.</li> <li>What narratives the map might support</li> <li>How the map could be used in a data-based advocacy campaign</li> <li>What questions emerge from the map that future research could help to clarify</li> </ul> <p>They should also prepare some of their own discussion questions based on the map, and lead the class in a short discussion after their presentation. Presentations and discussions should last 15-20 minutes.</p> <p>Each group will also write a 4-5 page paper that analyzes the chosen map, and that addresses the questions listed above; if possible, they are encouraged to incorporate feedback received during the presentation and class discussion into the final papers.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Students are welcome to use a map that they already encountered from one of the sources discussed in class, but are by no means required to do so. If students are having trouble finding an appropriate map, they are encouraged to consult with the course instructor, or with a reference librarian.
