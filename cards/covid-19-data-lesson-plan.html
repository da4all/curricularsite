Why was it a breakthrough and what were some of its limitations?</li> <li>What were some of the main challenges that the COVID Tracking Project ran up against?</li> <li>What solutions outlined in the second half of the podcast did you find most compelling? Which solutions seem hardest or easiest to implement?</li> <li>What are some of the issues around “aggregation” and “disaggregation” of data that are mentioned at the end of the podcast?

This participatory project invites users to submit their own content to the archive. The digital archive format will likely be frustrating and confusing to navigate and understand for some students. This is part of the rapid-response nature of the project and is a useful jumping off point for thinking about the information contained in archives, how that information is collected and made usable, and their silences and gaps.</em></p> </blockquote> <h3 id="explore-the-archive">Explore the Archive</h3> <p><strong><em>Individually:</em></strong> Take several minutes and start to explore the website. As you do so, take notes on the following:</p> <ul> <li>What seems to be in here?</li> <li>How is it organized?</li> <li>How easy is it to find something you’re looking for?</li> <li>How easy is it to stumble upon something that interests you?</li> <li>What challenges are you facing as a user?</li> <li>Go to the “Advanced Search” page for the archive. Search for a topic that interests you. Scroll through the first 5-10 collection items that appear and choose one of them. What kind of information is included in an “item”? How does it seem to be organized?</li> <li>What questions do you have about the archive based on this first exploration?</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Whole class:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>Which types (images, written reflections, audio files, etc.) of submissions are most useful in painting a picture of this COVID-19 year experience? Why?</li> <li>Which types of submissions resonated the least with you? Why?</li> <li>What was the user experience like in navigating the archive?</li> </ul> <h3 id="silences-in-the-archive">Silences in the Archive</h3> <p>When examining any archive or dataset, it’s important to always be on the lookout for its silences - ie. not just what information is in there, but also what is MISSING. One way to approach this is to study the geographical coverage of an archive or dataset. For the COVID-19 Archive, we’re going to use the <a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/WorldMap" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Global Pandemic Map</a> to examine where its items came from.</p> <p>.ve-iframe https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/WorldMap width=80% height=800px <br><br> <strong><em>Individually:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>Start with the most zoomed-out global scale and zoom into particular regions of the world: what countries are MOST represented and LEAST represented?</li> <li>Zoom down to your particular school. How well represented is YOUR surrounding geographical area in the COVID-19 Archive. Is your geographical area well-represented or poorly represented in this archive? Why do you think this is the case?</li> <li>Explore uploaded items that are closest to your institution. What seems to be in there? Whose experiences are reflected in these items? Whose experiences and voices seem to be missing?</li> <li>Brainstorm a list of 5 items you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area.</li> </ul> <h2 id="activity2">Activity 2: Metadata and Contributing to the COVID-19 Archive</h2> <p>The COVID-19 Archive is a collection of individual items (news articles, photographs, written memories, oral history recordings, etc.) about the pandemic. But to make these items discoverable, the archive has to also collect information about them. This is called “metadata.” Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this short video</a> to gain a better understanding of this concept:</p> <p>.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE width=70% caption=”The Metadata Librarian Explains Metadata” (December 4, 2014)</p> <h3 id="working-in-pairs">Working in pairs:</h3> <ul> <li>Share your brainstormed list of 5 items you thought of that you could add to this archive that would help ‘round out’ the collection by representing your geographic area.</li> <li>Choose one item from your combined list to contribute to the archive. <em>Note: although you can make your own information as a contributor anonymous, the item you choose will be publicly available. Think about the issue of privacy when selecting your item.</em> </li> <li>Go to <a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/Share" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this page</a> and fill out the template to contribute your item: <ul> <li>Work as a group and try to reach a consensus on what to include in the different metadata fields to describe the item.</li> <li>Note: it is recommended that you check the box to share this story anonymously, unless you want your personal information linked to the item.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="whole-class-debrief">Whole class debrief:</h3> <ul> <li>Based on the video about metadata and your own experience in adding metadata to an item, what is the purpose of metadata and why is it important?</li> <li>What challenges did you have in writing the metadata for your item? What was the hardest part? Was anything frustrating or confusing?</li> </ul> <h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial: Spreadsheet Practice</h2> <p>You’re going to practice your spreadsheet skills using a subset of data that was collected through The COVID Tracking Project - the same initiative you learned about in the podcast episode you listened to for today. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">following Google Sheet</a> contains a subset of data from the project (note: in order to make it easier to work with it does not include ALL the data that was collected by the project):</p> <p>.ve-iframe https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing width=80%</p> <h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3> <ul> <li>Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2xZ1ctyRLNfIBR0HfAp7oJ3fQBs2sUNya509E1kS_M/edit?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google spreadsheet</a> </li> <li>Create a new, empty sheet (<a href="https://www.shorttutorials.com/google-docs-spreadsheet/add-new-sheet.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">instructions</a>) and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lesson-2.4</code> </li> <li>In the original Google Sheet of COVID data, use a filter to only look at data from a single state (you can choose your home state or that of your school)</li> <li>Copy and paste this single state’s data into your newly created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lesson-2.4</code> sheet.</li> <li>The column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">positiveIncrease</code> is a daily report of new COVID19 cases (suspected and confirmed) in that state reported for that day.

Sort your data by this column to find out: what was the <strong>largest number of COVID19 hospitalizations reported in your state</strong> in a single day and <strong>what date did that occur</strong>?</li> <li>Add a new column named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allCases</code>: write a formula in the first cell that adds up (ie. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum()</code>) the daily positive cases (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">positiveIncrease</code>) and daily negative cases (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">negativeIncrease)</code> for that day. Autofill that formula all the way down your rows.</li> <li>Add a new column named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">percentPositive</code>: write a formula that calculates the daily positive cases as a percentage of ALL daily cases (positive + negative) - ie. what percentage of test results were positive?</li> <li>Add a new column named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hospitalizedToPositive</code>: write a formula that calculates a ratio of the number of hospitalizations for that day vs. the total new positive cases for a day - ie. what percentage of of people testing positive for COVID were hospitalized?</li> </ul> <h3 id="whole-class-debrief-1">Whole class debrief:</h3> <h4 id="instructor-note-1">Instructor Note:</h4> <blockquote> <p><em>It is easy to forget when working with these nice whole numbers that there was a very messy process behind their creation.
