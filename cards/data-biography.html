This is the dataset you will be examining: <a href="https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Philadelphia African American Census 1847</a>. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset that addresses the following:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Introduce</strong> the dataset and its contents. What kind of information is in there? How much data is there?</li> <li> <strong>Where</strong> did it come from?</li> <li> <strong>Who</strong> collected, processed, and made it available?</li> <li> <strong>How</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li> <li> <strong>Why</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li> <li> <strong>How</strong> is it stored today? How did you access it?</li> <li> <strong>Potential problems</strong> with the data—are there any limitations, biases, missing data or gaps, or ethical considerations to consider when using this data?</li> </ul> <p>Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of these questions will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So “Who collected it?” needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.</p> <h2 id="part-2-reflection">Part 2: Reflection</h2> <p>Based on your data biography of the <a href="https://ds-pages.swarthmore.edu/paac/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Philadelphia African American Census 1847 data set</a>, write 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on lessons this example could hold for working with historical data in order <strong>to pursue contemporary data advocacy projects.</strong> In your response, please draw on your analysis of how the data for the Philadelphia African American Consensus 1847 was collected, processed, and made available - as well as the potential problems you identified.</p> <p class="card-text"> <small class="text-muted"> <i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired"></i>  Domain: <a href="https://da4asandbox.github.io//curricularsite//processing-data">Processing Data</a> </small> <br> <small class="text-muted"> <i class="fa-solid fa-sitemap"></i>  Subdomain: Analyzing Data </small> <br> <small class="text-muted"> <i class="fas fa-file"></i>  Type of Resource: Assignment </small> </p> </div> </div> </body> </html>
