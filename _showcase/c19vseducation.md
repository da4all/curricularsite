## [Text from "U.S. Education in the Time of Covid"](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/annualreports/topical-studies/covid/)

Beginning in March 2020, the American education system was confronted with unprecedented challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic caused the closures of many U.S. schools to in-person learning. Schools quickly transitioned to remote learning models, and the most lingering question—for parents, students, and educators—was this: When will U.S. schools re-open for full-time in-person learning?

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has gathered highlights from a variety of data sources to provide a composite, high-level view of the complex American education landscape since the onset of the pandemic. In this first installment of the pandemic data hub, we provide findings related to

- changes in in-person instruction that have occurred over the last 2 years at both the elementary/secondary level and the postsecondary level;
- technology assistance that K-12 schools have provided to students and families;
- social and academic supports that K-12 schools have offered;
- changes in school staffing that have occurred at K-12 schools; and
- economic and social impacts on postsecondary students.
In subsequent installments, we will explore key findings related to how the pandemic has potentially impacted achievement and opportunities to learn.

For more in-depth results underlying the highlights presented here, readers are encouraged to access the reports and dashboards via the links provided in each theme page.
